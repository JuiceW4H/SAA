## AWS Lambda

* Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)
* You provide specialized, short-running, and focused code to Lambda and it takes care of running it and billing you for the duration that a function runs.
* The environment has a direct memory (indirect CPU) allocation.
* A key part of Serverless Architectures.
* An Event-Driven service.
* Can be chained together.

Lambda Function
	\- a piece of code/deployment package that Lambda runs.
	\- uses a runtime (e.g. Python, Java, etc). 
	\- loaded and run into a runtime environment.

Lambda@Edge 
	\- allows you to run Lambda functions at the edge locations of the CloudFront CDN.

**Runtimes Lambda Supports**
* Python
* Ruby
* Java
* Go
* C#/.NET
* Node.js

**Lambda Overview**

![Serverless and Application Services-07-31-2024](images/Serverless%20and%20Application%20Services-07-31-2024.png)

* Custom runtimes require Layers.
* Docker is an anti-pattern for Lambda.
* Lambda Functions are stateless meaning no data is left over from a previous invocation (not always the case).
* You can define the memory (128MB to 10240MB in 1MB steps) that Lambda Functions (Runtime Environment) use and this increases the vCPU indirectly.
* 1769MB of Memory = 1 vCPU
* Runtime Environment has disk space allocation with 512MB (Default) up to 10240MB mounted as /tmp.

Function Timeout
	\- Lambda Functions can run for up to 900 Seconds or 15 Minutes.
	\- for anything beyond 15 Minutes you can’t use Lambda directly.

* Security for a Lambda Function is controlled through Execution Roles or IAM Roles assumed by Lambda Function/s.

**Common Uses:**

* Serverless Applications (S3, API Gateway, Lambda)
* File Processing (S3, S3 Events, Lambda)
* Database Triggers (DynamoDB, DynamoDB Streams, Lambda)
* Serverless CRON (EventBridge/CW Events, Lambda)
* Real-time Stream Data Processing (Kinesis, Lambda)

CRON Job
	\- scheduled tasks.

**2 Networking Modes of Lambda**

1. Public (Default)
	\- can access public AWS services and the Public Internet.
	\- running in the Public AWS network.
	\- best performance because there is no customer specific networking is required.

![Serverless and Application Services-07-31-2024-1](images/Serverless%20and%20Application%20Services-07-31-2024-1.png)

* Lambda Functions have no access to VPC based services unless Public IPs are provided and security controls allow external access. 

2. VPC Networking
	\- can freely access other VPC based resources assuming any Network ACLs or Security Groups allow that access.

![Serverless and Application Services-07-31-2024-2](images/Serverless%20and%20Application%20Services-07-31-2024-2.png)

* Lambda functions running inside a VPC obey all VPC networking rules.
* VPC Endpoints can provide access to Public AWS services.
* NatGW and IGW are required for VPC Lambdas to access internet resources.
* A single connection between the Lambda Service VPC and your VPC is created for every unique combination of SGs and Subnets used by your Lambda Functions.
* 90 seconds of initial setup. 

**Security of Lambda Functions**

* In order for Lambda Functions to access any AWS services it needs to be provided with an Execution Role.
* Lambda also has Resource Policies.

Execution Role
	\- a role assumed by Lambda.
	\- by doing so the code within the environment gains the permissions of that role based on that role’s permissions policy.
	\- similar to EC2 Instance Role.

Resource Polices
	\- controls who can interact with a specific Lambda Function.
	\- used to allow external accounts or certain services to invoke a Lambda Function.
	\- can be changed via CLI or API.

**Logging**

* Lambda uses CloudWatch, CloudWatch Logs, and X-Ray for logging and monitoring.
* Logs from Lambda Executions go to CloudWatch Logs.
*  Metrics such as invocation success/failure, retries, latency, are stored in CloudWatch.
* Lambda can be integrated with X-Ray for Distributed Tracing.
* CloudWatch Logs require permissions via Execution Role (there are pre-built permissions).

**3 Ways a Lambda Function can be Invoked**

1. Synchronous Invocation
	\- generally used when when it’s a human directly or indirectly invoking a Lambda Function. 

![Serverless and Application Services-07-31-2024-3](images/Serverless%20and%20Application%20Services-07-31-2024-3.png)

* CLI/API invoke a Lambda Function, passing in data and waiting for a response.
* Lambda functions responds with data or fails (Success or Fails).
* Errors or Retries are handled within the client.

2. Asynchronous Invocation
	\- used when AWS services invoke Lambda Functions on your behalf.
	\- invoking a Lambda Function and not waiting for the response.

![Serverless and Application Services-07-31-2024-4](images/Serverless%20and%20Application%20Services-07-31-2024-4.png)

* Lambda is responsible for reprocessing in the event of a failure.
* Reprocessing value is configurable between 0 and 2 times.
* Function Code needs to be idempotent.
* Lambda can send events to Dead Letter Queues after repeated failed processing for Diagnostic Processing.
* Lambda supports Destinations meaning events processed by Lambda can be delivered to other Services/Destinations.

Idempotent Operation
	\- you can run an operation as many times as you want and the outcome will be the same.

3. Event Source Mappings
	\- typically used on Streams or Queues, which don’t generate events to invoke Lambda.
	\- uses permissions from the Lambda Execution Role to access source service. 

* Looks for new data and gets back Source Batches.
* Source Batches are then broken up as required based on a Batch Size which is then sent to Lambda as Event Batches.
* Source service isn’t delivering an event, but Event Source Mapping is instead reading from that source.
* SQS Queues or SNS Topics can be used for any discarded failed event batches.

**Lambda Versions**

* Lambda Functions can have versions.
* A Version is the code and the configuration of that Lambda Function.
* Once Published that version is Immutable and has its own ARN.
* $Latest points at the latest version of a Lambda Function.
* Can create Aliases which points to specific versions and these can be changed.

**Lambda Startup Times**

* Lambda code runs inside a runtime environment.

Execution Context
	\- a small container allocated with an amount of resource which runs your Lambda code. 

* Environment itself is created first.
* Runtimes that are required will be downloaded and installed (Cold Start).
* If the same Lambda Function is invoked again without too much of a gap it will use the same Execution Context (Warm Start).
* Too long of a gap between invocations will enforce deletion of the existing Context restarting the cycle.

Cold Start
	\- a full creation and configuration including function code download.
	\- takes 100 milliseconds or more.

Warm Start
	\- doesn’t need to setup the environment or download packages.
	\- context just receives event and begins processing.

Lambda SnapStart
	\- a feature introduced by AWS to reduce the cold start latency of Java-based AWS Lambda functions.

Provisioned Concurrency
	\- AWS will create and keep X amount of contexts warm and ready to use which improves start speeds.

* You can also use the temp space to pre-download things within an Execution Context.
* When you create a Lambda Function generally, most things go to the Lambda Function Handler.
* Anything you create outside of the Lambda Function Handler will be made available for any future Function invocations in the same Execution Context.

## CloudWatch Events and EventBridge

* Allows you to implement an Architecture which can observe if X happens, or if Y happens at a certain time, then do Z.
* X is a supported service that generates an event.
* Y can certain time or time period (Cron Format).
* Z is a supported target service to deliver the event to.
* Both operate using a Default Entity which is an Event Bus.
* Both have a Default Event Bus for a single AWS account.
* Events are JSON structures.

Event Bus
	\- a stream of events which occur from any supported service inside that AWS account.

* You can create Rules which pattern match events that occur on the buses.

Event Pattern Rules
	\- when they see an event that matches they deliver it to the target.

Schedule Based Rules 
	\- which pattern matches rules, but matches to a certain date and time, or ranges of dates and times (Cron Expression).

* Rules are linked to an Event Bus.
* Routes event to 1 or more targets which you define on that Rule.

![Serverless and Application Services-07-31-2024-5](images/Serverless%20and%20Application%20Services-07-31-2024-5.png)

**CloudWatch Events**

* Delivers a near real-time stream of system events which describe changes in AWS products and services.
* Only has 1 Event Bus.

**EventBridge (CloudWatch Events V2)**

* Service that is replacing CloudWatch Events.
* Can perform all of the same bits of functionality that CloudWatch Events can produce.
* Can handle events from 3rd Parties as well as custom applications.
* You can create additional Event Buses.

## Serverless Architecture

* Serverless is an architecture, but it’s more a software architecture than a hardware architecture (FaaS Products).
* Aiming to manage few, if any servers (Low Overhead).
* Applications are collections of small and specialized functions.
* Runs in Stateless and Ephemeral environments (Duration Billing).
* Everything is Event-Driven meaning nothing is running until it’s required.
* Managed services are used where possible.

**Serverless Architecture Example**

![Serverless and Application Services-07-31-2024-6](images/Serverless%20and%20Application%20Services-07-31-2024-6.png)

* AWS Cognito is capable of swapping Google Token for AWS Temporary Credentials.

Elastic Transcoder Service
	\- a managed service offered by AWS which can take in media and manipulate it.
	\- transcode or generate media of different sizes from one master video file.

## Simple Notification Service (SNS)

* A highly available, durable, secure, pub-sub messaging service.
* Public AWS service meaning you need network connectivity with the public AWS endpoints.
* Coordinates the sending and delivery of messages.
* Messages are payloads which are up to 256KB in size.

SNS Topic
	\- the base entity of the SNS service.
	\- it is where permissions are controlled as well as where most of the SNS configuration is defined.

Publisher
	\- architectural name for something which sends messages to a Topic.

Subscribers
	\- receiver of messages.

**Forms of Subscribers:**

* HTTP/HTTPS
* Email (JSON)
* SQS
* Mobile Push
* SMS Messages
* Lambda

**SNS Architecture**

![Serverless and Application Services-07-31-2024-7](images/Serverless%20and%20Application%20Services-07-31-2024-7.png)

* Filter allows for you send to messages to subscribers that only relate to their function.

Fanout Architecture
	\- when you have single SNS topic with multiple SQS Queues as subscribers.

* SNS offers delivery status meaning you can confirm the status of delivery of messages to those subscribers.
* Supports delivery retries.
* Highly Available and Scalable service.
* Regionally Resilient service.
* Capable of Server-Side Encryption (SSE).
* Capable of being used Cross Accounts by applying a Topic Policy (Resource Policy).

SNS Message Filtering
	\- allows you to assign a filter policy to the topic subscription, and the subscriber will only receive a message that they are interested in.

## Step Functions

* Maximum duration for State Machine executions within Step Functions is 1 year.

State Machines
	\- long-running serverless workflows.
	\- a base entity of a Step Function and has a start , state and an end point.
	\- designed to perform an activity or perform a flow, which consists of lots of individual components and maintain the idea of data between those states.
	\- max duration of 1 year.
	\- generally used for backend processing.

States
	\- things that occur inside a State Machine.
	\- can do things, decide, and they all take in data, modify data, and output data.

**2 Types of Workflows in Step Functions**

* Influences the speed and maximum duration.

1. Standard Workflow (Default)
	\- has a 1 year execution limit.

2. Express Workflow
	\- designed for high volume event-processing workloads.
	\- can run for up to 5 minutes.
	\- for things that are highly transaction and require more processing guarantees.

* You can create a Template to create and export State Machines once they’re configured to your liking.

Amazon States Language (ASL)
	\- based on JSON.
	\- used to create and export State Machines once they’re configured to your liking.

*  IAM Roles are used to give permissions to interact with other AWS services.

**Types of States**

1. Succeed and Fail States
	\- if the process through the State Machine ever reaches one of these States then it either succeeds or fails.

2. Wait State
	\- waits for a certain period of time or it will wait until a specific date and time.
	\- holds or pauses the processing of the State Machine Workflow until the duration has passed or until that specific point in time.

3. Choice State
	\- allows the State Machine to take a different path depending on an input.

4. Parallel State
	\- allows you to create parallel branches within a State Machine.
	\- for performing multiple sets of things at the same time.

5. Map State
	\- accepts a list of things 
	\- for each item in that list the Map State performs an action or a set of actions based on that particular item.

6. Task State
	\- represents a single unit of work performed by a State Machine.
	\- allows you to perform actions or actually do things.

* The architecture of the State Machine is that it coordinates the work occurring.
* Task states coordinate with all the external services to perform that actual work.

**Step Functions Architecture**

![Serverless and Application Services-07-31-2024-8](images/Serverless%20and%20Application%20Services-07-31-2024-8.png)

## API Gateway 101

* A service which lets you create and manage APIs.
* API Gateway acts as an endpoint or entry point for applications looking to talk to your services.
* Intermediary between applications and integrations (backend services).
* Supports OpenAPI spec.
* A Public Service and it can act as a frontend for services running within AWS or On-Premises.
* HTTP APIs, REST APIs, and Web Socket APIs.

Application Programming Interface (API)
	\- a way that applications communicate with each other.

Throttling
	\- limits how often individuals use APIs.
	\- for protecting backend servers.

**API Gateway Architecture**

![Serverless and Application Services-07-31-2024-9](images/Serverless%20and%20Application%20Services-07-31-2024-9.png)

**3 Phases in API Gateway Interactions**

1. Request
	\- where the client makes a request through the API Gateway.
	\- it authorizes, validates, and transforms incoming requests from the client into a form that the integration can handle.

2. Response
	\- response is provided back to the client.
	\- takes the output from the backend, which transforms, prepares, and returns it to the client.

* Integrates with CloudWatch to store logging and metric based data for requests and response side.

API Gateway Cache
	\- can be used to reduce the number of calls made to the backend and improve client performance.

**Authentication**

![Serverless and Application Services-07-31-2024-10](images/Serverless%20and%20Application%20Services-07-31-2024-10.png)

* API Gateway can use Cognito user pools for authentication.
* Can be extended to use Lambda based authorization or Custom authorization.
* IAM can also be used to authenticate and authorize with API Gateway by passing in credentials in the headers.

**Different Types of Endpoint Types**

Edge-Optimized Endpoints
	\- any incoming requests are routed to the nearest CloudFront Point of Presence (POP).

Regional Endpoints
	\- used when you have clients in the same region.

Private Endpoints
	\- only accessible within a VPC via an interface point.

**API Gateway Stages**

![Serverless and Application Services-07-31-2024-11](images/Serverless%20and%20Application%20Services-07-31-2024-11.png)

* APIs are deployed to stages, and each stage has one deployment.
* Each stage has its own unique Endpoint URL and settings.
* You can rollback deployments on a stage.
* Stages can be enabled on canary deployments.
* When Canary Deployment is enabled, any new deployment which you make to that stage is actually deployed to a subpart of that stage.
* Stages enabled for canary deployments can be configured so a certain percentage of traffic is sent to the canary.
* This can be adjusted over time or the canary can be promoted to make it the new base 'stage’.

**API Gateway Errors**

1. 4XX Error Codes (Client Error)
	\- invalid requests on the client side.
	
	* 400 (Bad Request)
		\- generic client side error.
	
	* 403 (Access Denied)
		\- access denied error.
	
	* 429 (Throttling)
		\- indication that throttling is occurring.
		\- exceeded a configured throttling amount.

2. 5XX Error Code (Server Error)
	\- request from client is valid, but there are server/backend issues.

	* 502 (Bad Gateway Exception)
		\- bad output returned by backend service/s.
	
	* 503 (Service Unavailable)
		\- service unavailable
		\- backend endpoint is offline
	
	* 504 (Integration Failure/Timeout)
		\- requests that take longer than 29 seconds will produce this error.

Error Code Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/CommonErrors.html

**API Gateway Caching**

* Without a cache services would be used in each and every request.
* Cache is defined per stage and could be anywhere from 500MB to 237GB in size.
* It Caches things by a Default of 300 seconds, but can be configured from 0 (Disabled) to a maximum of 3,600 seconds.
* Can be encrypted.
* Using a Cache means that calls will only be made to the backend when there is a Cache Miss.

## Simple Queueing Service (SQS)

* Provides managed message queues.
* An AWS Public Service.
* Highly available in a region by Default.
* Messages can be up to 256KB in size. Data that require more can be linked to the object inside the message.
* Clients can send messages to that Queue and other clients can poll the Queue.
* Received messages are hidden (VisibilityTimeout).
* Messages can be explicitly deleted once it has been processed, otherwise it will re-appear in the Queue.
* ASGs can scale and Lambdas invoked based on Queue length.
* Messages can live in an SQS Queue for 1 up to 14 days.
* Default Retention Period is 4 days.

Polling
	\- process of checking for any messages on a Queue.

VisibilityTimeout
	\- the amount of time that a message is hidden when it’s received.
	\- Default of 30 seconds.
	\- Can be set to 0 seconds up to 12 hours.

Dead-Letter Queue
	\- the Queue where problem messages can be moved to.
	\- allows you to do different sets of processing on messages that could be problematic.

**2 Types of Queues**

1. Standard
	\- guarantees at-least-once delivery, and make no guarantees on the order of that delivery.
	\- you could get the same message twice on 2 different polls and order could be different.
	\- similar to multi-lane highways they can scale at an infinite level.

2. First In First Out (FIFO)
	\- guarantees order and exactly-once delivery.
	\- single lane roads meaning performance is limited.
	\- 3,000 Messages per second with Batching.
	\- 300 messages per second without Batching.

* You are billed on requests.

Request
	\- a single request that you make to SQS.
	\- 1 request = 1-10 messages up to 64KB in total.
	\- operations that could be done on a messages inside the SQS

**SQS Architecture Sample**

![Serverless and Application Services-07-31-2024-12](images/Serverless%20and%20Application%20Services-07-31-2024-12.png)

**SNS and SQS Fanout**

![Serverless and Application Services-07-31-2024-13](images/Serverless%20and%20Application%20Services-07-31-2024-13.png)

* Take one event and create multiple different events that can be used independently.

**2 Ways to Poll an SQS Queue**

1. Short Polling (Immediate)
	\- uses 1 request and can received 0 or more messages.
	\- if a Queue has 0 messages on that Queue then it still consumes 1 Request.

2. Long Polling (waitTimeSeconds)
	\- where you can specific waitTimeSeconds.
	\- can be up to 20 seconds.
	\- up to 10 messages and 64KB will be counted as a single request.
	\- if messages are available on a Queue, when you launched the request then they will be received.
	\- otherwise it will wait for messages up to the configured waitTimeSeconds.

* SQS supports encryption at rest using KMS (SSE).
* Data by Default is encrypted in transit between SQS and any clients.
* Access to a Queue is based on Identity Policies or you can use Queue Policies.

Queue Policy
	\- a resource policy
	\- can allow access from external accounts (Identity Policies can’t).
	\- used to control access to a Queue.

## SQS Standard vs FIFO Queues

* Transactions Per Second (TPS)

**FIFO Queues**
	\- are like single-lane highways.
	\- can handle 300 messages/transactions without batching and 3,000 with batching.
	\- has High Throughput mode.
	\- guarantees order and exactly once processing.
	\- 20,000 message limit

Exactly-Once Processing
	\- removing the chance of duplicate message delivery.

Batching
	\- allows each transaction to contain 10 messages.

* FIFO Queues have to have a FIFO suffix in order to be a valid FIFO Queue.
* Great for workflow-based order processing, command ordering, and price adjustments.

**Standard Queues**
	\- are like multi-lane highways.
	\- near unlimited TPS.
	\- 120,000 message limit

Trade-offs:

* No rigid preservation of message ordering, Best Efforts only.
* At-least-once message delivery meaning messages can be delivered more than once.
* Ideal for decoupling components, workable architectures, or batch together items for future processing.

## SQS Delay Queue

![Serverless and Application Services-07-31-2024-14](images/Serverless%20and%20Application%20Services-07-31-2024-14.png)

* Allow you to postpone the delivery of messages to consumers.

VisibilityTimeout
	\- the amount of time that a message is hidden when it’s received.
	\- Default is 30 seconds.
	\- can be set from a range of 0 seconds to 12 hours.
	\- can be set on a per Queue or a per Message basis (ChangeMessageVisibility).

* Messages need to appear on the Queue and be received before VisibilityTimeout occurs.
* Used for error correction and automatic reprocessing.

**Delay Queue**
	\- we configure a value called DelaySeconds on that Queue.
	\- messages added to the Queue will start off in an invisible state for the set period of time.
	\- once the period expires the message will be visible on the Queue.
	\- Default is 0 seconds (disabled) and a maximum of 15 minutes.
	\- you can set this on a per message basis using Message Timers.

Message Timers
	\- allow a per-message invisibility to be set, overriding any Queue setting.
	\- not supported on FIFO queues.

* Generally used when you need to build in a delay in processing into your application.
* Performing certain sets of tasks before you process and etc.
* Used to support automatic reprocessing of problematic messages.

## SQS Dead-Letter Queues

![Serverless and Application Services-07-31-2024-15](images/Serverless%20and%20Application%20Services-07-31-2024-15.png)

* Designed to help you handle reoccurring failure while processing messages which are within an SQS Queue.
* Every time the message is received, the ReceiveCount attribute is incremented.

redrive policy
	\- specifies the Source Queue, Dead-Letter Queue, and the condition/s where message will be moved from one to the other
	\- defines a variable called maxReceivedCount.

* Setting up a DLQ allows you to configure an alarm for any messages which are delivered to a DLQ.
* DLQs are a separate area which allows you to perform separate, isolated diagnostics.
* You can examine contents.
* All SQS Queues have retention periods for messages.

Retention Period
	\- when a message ages past a certain and it has not been processed it will be dropped.

* When a message is added to a Queue it has an Enqueue Timestamp.
* Enqueue Timestamp is not adjusted when you move a message from a Normal Queue to a Dead-Letter Queue.

Enqueue Timestamp
	\- timestamp of the point that it was sent into the Queue.

## Kinesis Data Streams

* Kinesis is a scalable streaming service.
* Designed to ingest lots of data from lots of devices, or applications.
* Producers send data into a Kinesis Stream.
* A Public Service and Highly Available by design.
* Delivers in real-time (range of 200ms)

Stream
	\- basic entity of Kinesis.
	\- can scale from low to near infinite data rates.

* Streams store a 24-hour (Default) rolling window or accessibility window. Storage included.
* Can be increased of up to 365 days (additional cost).
* Can support multiple consumers accessing data from that moving window.

**Kinesis Architecture**

![Serverless and Application Services-07-31-2024-16](images/Serverless%20and%20Application%20Services-07-31-2024-16.png)

* Kinesis Streams scales through Shard Architecture.
* A Stream starts off with 1 Shard.
* Each Shard provides its own capacity, 1MB per second of ingestion capacity, and 2 MB per second of consumption.
* More Shards more expensive, but more performance.
* Window is also persistent (365 day window = 365 days worth of data stored by Kinesis).

Kinesis Data Records
	\- how data is stored on a Stream.
	\- maximum size of 1MB.
	\- are stored across Shards.

Kinesis Data Firehose
	\- connects to a Kinesis Stream and can move data which arrives onto the stream en masse into another AWS service.

**SQS vs Kinesis**

![Serverless and Application Services-07-31-2024-17](images/Serverless%20and%20Application%20Services-07-31-2024-17.png)

## Kinesis Data Firehose

* Kinesis Data Streams by Default, doesn’t offer a way to persist that data.

Kinesis Data Streams
	\- a product which provides a way for producers to send huge quantities of data into AWS. 
	\- storing that data for a window of time.
	\- allowing multiple consumers to consume that data at different rates.
	\- granular control on how data is ingested, processed, and consumed.

Kinesis Data Firehose
	\- a fully managed service to deliver data to supported services.
	\- service to load for data lakes, data stores, and analytics services.
	\- scales automatically and serverless.
	\- near-real-time
	\- for data delivery

* KDF accepts data and it offers near-real-time delivery of that data to destinations.
* Around a delay of 60 seconds.
* Supports transformation of data on the fly (Lambda)(can add latency).

Billing

* Billed on data volume passing through the service.
* pay-as-you-go

**Kinesis Data Firehose Architecture**

![Serverless and Application Services-07-31-2024-18](images/Serverless%20and%20Application%20Services-07-31-2024-18.png)

* Can deliver data to HTTP Endpoints (3rd Party Providers).
* Directly supports delivery to Splunk.
* Can deliver data to Redshift, ElasticSearch, and S3.
* Firehose can directly accept data from Producers or obtained through a Kinesis Data Stream.
* Firehose offers near real-time delivery.
* Buffers can be adjusted.
* Low Volume Producers = Delivers data in every 60 seconds
* High Volume Producers = Delivers data in every MB of data
* Delivery data to Redshift is not as direct as you are actually copying data to an S3 Bucket which will be used by Redshift.

**Use Case**

* Provide persistence to KDS.
* Store data to different formats.
* Deliver data into supported products.

## Kinesis Data Analytics

**Kinesis Data Streams**
	\- used to allow the large-scale ingestion of data into AWS and its consumption.

**Kinesis Data Firehose**
	\- provides delivery services to supported destinations in near real-time.
	\- can use Lambda to perform data transformation.

**Kinesis Data Analytics**
	\- a service which provides real-time processing of data which flows through it using SQL.
	\- ingests data from KDS or KDF.
	\- can optionally pull in static reference data from S3.
	\- can send data in real-time to destinations.

**Support KDA Destinations**

* Firehose and Firehose Supported Destinations (S3, Redshift, ElasticSearch, & Splunk).
* AWS Lambda
* Kinesis Data Streams

**Kinesis Data Analytics Architecture**

![Serverless and Application Services-07-31-2024-19](images/Serverless%20and%20Application%20Services-07-31-2024-19.png)

* You only pay for the data processed by KDA.

Reference Table
	\- a table that matches data contained within an S3 bucket.
	\- can be used to store static data or metadata.

**Use Case**

* Streaming data needing real-time SQL processing.
* Time-series analytics
* Real-time metrics for security and response teams.

## Kinesis Video Streams

* Allows you to ingest live video streaming data from Producers.
* Producers can be security cameras, smartphones, cars, drones, time-serialized audio, thermal, depth, and RADAR data.
* Once the data is inside AWS, consumers can access it frame-by-frame or as needed.
* Can persist data and encrypt data (In-Transit and At Rest).
* Can only access it via API not directly.
* Can integrate with other AWS services (e.g. Rekognition and Connect)

Rekognition Video
	\- provides deep learning-based intelligence for images and videos.

## Amazon Cognito - User and Identity Pools

* Service as a whole provides Authentication, Authorization, and User management for Web/Mobile Applications.

User Management
	\- to allow the creation and management of a serverless user database.

**2 Parts of Cognito**

1. User Pools
	\- end goal of a User Pool is to allow you to sign in and if successful you get a JSON Web Token (JWT).
	\- does not grant access to AWS services.
	\- also allows social sign-in provided by Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple and etc.
	\- also offers sign services using other identity types like SAML identity providers.
	\- just for signing up or signing in for user director and profile management services.
	\- for accessing self-managed resources Applications, DB, or API Gateway.

* User directory management and profiles, sign-up & sign-in (Customizable Web UI), MFA and other security features.

JSON Web Token
	\- can be used for authentication with applications, certain AWS products, but most AWS services cannot use JWTs.

2. Identity Pools
	\- aims to exchange a type of external identity for a set of Temporary AWS credentials.
	\- Unauthenticated identities or Authenticated identities can be used to give guest access to AWS resources.
	\- sign-ins take place on the external identity provider.
	\- 1 configuration per external ID provider.

* Identity Pools work by assuming an IAM Role on behalf of the Identity.

## AWS Glue 101

* A serverless Extract, Transformation & Load (ETL) System.
* AWS Glue is used to move and transform data between source and destination.
* Also crawls data sources and generates the AWS Glue Data Catalog.
* Data Source: Stores: S3, RDS, JDBC Compatible DBs, & DynamoDB
* Data Source: Streams: Kinesis Data Stream & Apache Kafka
* Data Targets: S3, RDS, JDBC DBs.

AWS Glue Data Catalog
	\- a collection of metadata combined with data management and search tools.
	\- persistent metadata about data sources within a region.
	\- provides 1 unique data catalog per region per account.

* Data is discovered by configuring Crawlers and giving them credentials and pointing them to sources.

Crawlers
	\- connects to data stores, determine schema, and create metadata in the data catalog.

Glue Jobs
	\- are extract, transform, and load jobs.
	\- can be started manually or invoked in an event-driven way.

* You are only billed for the resources that you consume.

Job Bookmarking
	\- keeps track of the last processed data, allowing succeeding jobs to run only to process new data.
	\- eliminates the need to reprocess old data.

## Amazon MQ 101

* Amazon MQ is an open-source message broker.
* Based on a managed implementation of Apache ActiveMQ.
* For systems that support JMS API, and protocols such as AQMP, mQTT, OpenWire, and STOMP.
* Provides both Queues (One-to-One) and Topics (One-to-Many).
* You are provided with message broker servers that can either be Single Instance or HA Pair (Active/Standby).
* VPC Based and not a Public Service.
* No native AWS integration meaning you cannot use it with other AWS services directly.

**Amazon MQ Architecture**

![Serverless and Application Services-07-31-2024-25](images/Serverless%20and%20Application%20Services-07-31-2024-25.png)

* Uses EFS for shared storage between the brokers.

## Amazon AppFlow

* AppFlow is designed for secure and easy data integration between AWS services and Third Party SaaS applications.
* Allows you to exchange data between applications using Flows.
* Applications are connected to using connectors and the main unit of configuration is a Flow.

Flow
	\- consists of a Source connector and a Destination connector and other optional components.

* By Default, it uses Public Endpoints which allows it to interact with public SaaS applications.
* Can work with PrivateLink to access private resources.
* Use AppFlow Custom Connector SDK for building your own connector.

**AppFlow Architecture**

![Serverless and Application Services-07-31-2024-27](images/Serverless%20and%20Application%20Services-07-31-2024-27.png)

Connections
	\- stores the configuration and credentials to access applications.
	\- defined separately from Flows meaning it can be reused across different Flows.

Field Mapping
	\- tells AppFlow what fields we’re interested in.

**Amazon Simple Workflow Service (SWF)**
	\- is a web service that makes it easy to coordinate work across distributed application components.
	\- more granular control compared to Step Function.

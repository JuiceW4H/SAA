## Introduction to Containers

* It provides an isolated environment, which an application can run within.
* A container runs as a process within the host Operating System.
* Consumes resources only for the application and any runtime environment elements like libraries and dependencies.

**Virtualization Architecture**

* A container is a running copy of what’s known as a Docker Image.
* Images are created from a base image or scratch.
* Images contain readonly layers, changes are layered onto the image using a differential architecture. 
* In actuality the layers should be reversed in the given Docker Image Architecture (Image Anatomy).

Docker Image
	\- made up of multiple independent layers.
	\- created initially by a using a Dockerfile. 

Dockerfile
	\- used to build Docker images. Each step creates file system layers.

**Container Anatomy**

Docker Container
	\- is just a running copy of a Docker image.
	\- has an additional read-write file system layer.

**Container Registry**

* Container Registry is a registry or a hub of container images.

Docker Hosts
	\- servers running a Container Engine.
	\- can run many containers based on one or more images.

**Key Concepts:**

* Dockerfiles are used to build images.
* Portable, self-contained, always run as expected.
* Containers are lightweight as file system layers are shared.
* Containers only run the application and environment it needs.
* Provides much of the isolation VM’s do.
* Ports are ‘exposed’ to the host and beyond.
* Application stacks can be multi-container.


**Elastic Container Service (ECS) Concepts**

* ECS is a managed container based compute service.
* A service that accepts containers and some instructions that you provide and it orchestrates where and how to run those containers.
* It isn’t highly available by itself.

![Containers & Elastic Container Service (ECS)-07-20-2024-5](images/Containers%20&%20Elastic%20Container%20Service%20(ECS)-07-20-2024-5.png)

Clusters
	- where your container run from.

Elastic Container Registry
	- AWS’ container registry.
	- where your containers are stored.

Container Definition
	- points to where the container is stored and what port/s is exposed.
	- provides just enough information about the single container that you want to define.

Task Definitions
	- a Task in ECS represents a self-contained application.
	- could have one container defined inside it or many.
	- stores the resources used by the task (e.g. CPU, Networking, Task Role, & etc).

* When you create a task definition within the ECS UI, you actually create a container definition along with it.

Task Role
	- an IAM role that a task can assume.
	- best practice ways of giving containers within ECS permissions to access AWS products and services.

Service Definition (Wrapper)
	- a service that lets you configure replacing failed tasks or scaling, or how to distribute load.
	- defines a service and a service is how we can define how we want a task to scale, or how many copies you’d like to run.
	- can add capacity and resilience.
	- a group of tasks handling a long-running computing work that can be stopped and restarted.\

* It’s tasks or services that you deploy into an ECS cluster and this applies whether it’s EC2 or Fargate based.

## ECS Cluster Types

* ECS Management Components
	\- handles high-level tasks like scheduling, orchestration, cluster management, and placement engine.

**ECS - EC2 Mode**

* ECS Cluster is created within a VPC inside your AWS account.
* EC2 instances are used to run containers.
* You are expected to manage the EC2 container hosts through ECS Tooling.

Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
	\- a way of controlling Horizontal Scaling for EC2 instances.

**Architecture:**

![Containers & Elastic Container Service (ECS)-07-20-2024-6](images/Containers%20&%20Elastic%20Container%20Service%20(ECS)-07-20-2024-6.png)

**ECS - Fargate Mode**

* Fargate is a cluster model or a serverless option.
* Fargate offers a similar isolation to EC2 even if you are in a shared pool/hardware.
* Still uses a VPC and a Cluster.
* Tasks are injected into your VPC and given an ENI.
* You only pay for the containers that you’re using based on the resources that they consume.

**Architecture**

## Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

* A Managed Container Image Registry Service.
* Docker Hub for AWS.
* Each AWS account has a Public and Private registry.
* Each registry can have many repositories.
* Each repository can contain many images.
* Images can have several tags (have to be unique in the repository).

Public Registry
	\- means that anyone can have read-only access to anything within that registry.
	\- read-write requires permissions.
	\- anyone can pull, to push you need permissions.

Private Registry
	\- permissions are required for any operation (read, read-write, push, and pull).

**Benefits:**

* Integrated with IAM
* Offers Image Scanning
	* Basic
	* Enhanced (Inspector Product)
* Offers near real-time metrics delivered into CloudWatch (Auth, Push, Pull).
* Logs API actions into CloudTrail.
* Generates events which are delivered into EventBridge.
* Offers replication of Container Images.
	* Cross-Region
	* Cross-Account

## Kubernetes 101

* An open-source cloud agnostic container orchestration system.
* Used to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

**Cluster Architecture of Kubernetes**

![Containers & Elastic Container Service (ECS)-07-20-2024-9](images/Containers%20&%20Elastic%20Container%20Service%20(ECS)-07-20-2024-9.png)

Cluster
	\- a highly available cluster of compute resources which are organized to work as one unit.

Cluster Control Pane
	\- manages the cluster scheduling, applications, scaling, and deploying.

Cluster Nodes
	\- A VM or Physical server which functions as a worker in the cluster.
	\- compute within a Kubernetes Cluster.
	\- runs your containerized applications.

Containerd or Docker Software
	\- handles container operations.

Kubelet
	\- an agent used to interact with the Cluster Control Pane.

Kubernetes API
	\- used for communication between control plane and Kubelet agent.

Pods
	\- are the smallest units of computing in Kubernetes.
	\- “one-container-one-pod” is very common.
	\- Pods are Non-Permanent.\

**Cluster Control Plane Components:**

![Containers & Elastic Container Service (ECS)-07-20-2024-10](images/Containers%20&%20Elastic%20Container%20Service%20(ECS)-07-20-2024-10.png)

1. kube-apiserver
	\- the front end for the Kubernetes control plane.
	\- what nodes and other cluster elements interact with.
	\- can be horizontally scaled for HA and performance.

2. etcd
	\- provides a highly-available key value store used within the cluster.
	\- a simple database running within the cluster, which acts the the main backing store for the cluster.

3. kube-scheduler
	\- identifies any pods within the cluster with no assigned node and assigns a node based on resource requirements, deadlines, affinity/anti-affinity, data locality, and any constraints.

4. cloud-controller-manager (Optional Compononent)
	\- provides cloud-specific control logic.
	\- it allows you to link Kubernetes with a cloud providers APIs.

5. kube-controller-manager
	\- a collection of cluster controller processes.

	* Node Controller
		\- responsible for monitoring and responding to any node outages.

	* Job Controller
		\- responsible for running pods in order to execute jobs.
		\- one-off tasks (jobs).

	* Endpoint Controller
		\- populates endpoints in the cluster.
		\- links services to pods.

	* Service Account & Token Controller
		\- responsible for account and API token creation.

6. kube-proxy
	\- a network proxy.
	\- runs on each node as it coordinates networking with the control plane.
	\- it helps implement “services” and configures rules allowing communications with pods from inside or outside of the cluster.

Key Concepts:

* Cluster
	\- a deployment of Kubernetes.
	\- provides management, orchestration, healing, and service access.

* Nodes
	\- provide actual compute resources.
	\- pods are placed on nodes to run.

* Pods
	\- one or more containers and is the smallest admin unit within Kubernetes.
	\- one container one pod architecture is cleaner.
	\- not a permanent thing.

* Service
	\- provide an abstraction from pods.
	\- what we typically understand as an application.
	\- an application can be containerized across many pods, but the service is the consistent thing the abstraction.

* Job
	\- an ad-hoc thing inside the cluster.
	\- creates one or more pods until completion.

* Ingress
	\- exposes a way into a service.
	\- to go in essentially.

* Ingress Controller
	\- a piece of software which arranges for the underlying hardware to allow ingress.

* Any storage in Kubernetes by default is ephemeral provided locally by node.

* Persistent Volumes
	- a volume whose lifecycle lives beyond any 1 pod using it.

## Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) 101

* AWS Managed Kubernetes implementation.
* EKS can run on AWS itself, AWS Outpost, EKS Distro, EKS Anywhere.
* Control plane scales based on load and runs on multiple Availability Zones.
* Integrates with AWS services (ECR, ELB, IAM, VPC, etc.)
* EKS Cluster = EKS Control Plane & EKS Nodes.
* etcd distributed across multiple Availability Zones.
* Storage provides include EBS, EFS, FSx Lustre, FSx for NetApp ONTAP (Persistent Storage).

**Different Ways of Handling a Node:**

* Self Managed
	\- EC2 instances you manage and you’re billed for based on normal EC2 pricing.

* Managed Node Groups
	\- still uses EC2, but the product handles the provisioning and lifecycle management.

* Fargate Pods
	\- with Fargate you don’t have to worry about provisioning, configuring, or scaling groups of instances.
	\- you instead define Fargate profiles which mean that pods can start on Fargate.
	\- similar to ECS Fargate.

**EKS Architecture**

**EKS Distro**
	\- helps you manually run clusters using a Kubernetes distribution of compatible versions of the latest release and its dependencies, tested for reliability and security.

* Supports 2 Auto Scaling products

1. Karpenter
	\- a flexible, high-performance Kubernetes cluster autoscaler that launches appropriately sized compute resources, like Amazon EC2 instances, in response to changing application load.

2. Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler
	\- automatically adjusts the number of nodes in your cluster when pods fail or are rescheduled onto other nodes. The Cluster Autoscaler uses Auto Scaling groups.

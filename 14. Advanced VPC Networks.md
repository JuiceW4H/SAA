## VPC Flow Logs

* Provide details of traffic flow within the Private network.
* It only captures packet metadata (Source IP and Port, Destination IP and Port, Packet Size and etc).
* Works by attaching virtual monitors within VPC and can be applied at 3 different levels.
* Not real-time.
* Can be configured to go to multiple Destinations (S3 or CloudWatch Logs).

**3 Different Levels**

* Flow Logs capture metadata from the capture level and downwards.

1. VPC Level
	\- monitors every ENI in every subnet within the VPC.

2. Subnet Level
	\- monitors ENIs within that specific Subnet.

3. ENI Level
	\- monitors only that specific ENI.

Amazon Athena
	\- an ad hoc querying engine which uses a Schema on read architecture.
	\- for querying logs stored in S3 using SQL.

## Egress-Only Internet Gateway

* Internet Gateway which only allows connections to be initiated from inside a VPC to outside.
* Basically a NAT Gateway for IPv6.
* It is Highly Available by Default across all AZs in the region and scales as required.

**Difference between IPv4 and IPv6**

* IPv4 addresses are Public or Private.
* NAT allows Private IPs to access Public Networks without allowing externally initiated connections.
* IPv6 IPs are all Public.
* Egress-Only is outbound-only for IPv6.

## VPC Endpoints - Gateway

* Gateway Endpoints provide Private Access to S3 and DynamoDB.
* Allows you to provide access to these services without implementing a Public Infrastructure.
* These are created per service per region.
* This doesn’t actually go into VPC subnets.
* When you allocate the Gateway Endpoint to Subnets, a Prefix List is added to a Route Table pointing to the Gateway Endpoint.
* Highly Available across all AZs in a region by Default.
* Endpoint Policy is used to control what it can access.
* Only for accessing services in the same region no Cross-Region services.

Private Access
	\- allow a private-only resource inside a VPC or any resource inside a private-only VPC to access S3 and DynamoDB.

Prefix List
	\- a logical entity which represents S3 or DynamoDB.

Endpoint Policy
	\- allows control over what things can be connected to by that Gateway Endpoint.

**2 Main Use Cases**

1. Allowing a Private VPC access to pubic resources without allowing other public access.
2. Private-only S3 Buckets or Prevent Leaky Buckets by allowing access only from a Gateway Endpoint.

* Limitation of Gateway Endpoints is that they are only access inside that specific VPC.

## VPC Endpoints - Interface

* Provide Private Access to AWS Public Services.
* Not Highly Available by Default.
* Interfaces inside a VPC which are added to specific Subnets inside that VPC.
* Security Groups are used to control Network Access of Interface Endpoints.
* Can still use Endpoint Policies.
* Only support TCP and IPv4.
* It uses PrivateLink behind the scenes.
* Can be used on everything else except DynamoDB.

PrivateLink
	\- a product that allows external services to be injected into your VPC either from AWS or from 3rd Parties.

* Interface Endpoint provides a New service endpoint DNS and that name can be used to directly access the service via Interface Endpoint.
* Application can optionally use these endpoints.

Endpoint Regional DNS
	\- one single DNS name that works for whatever AZ you’re using to access the Interface Endpoint.
	\- good for simplicity and high availability.

Endpoint Zonal DNS
	\- resolves to that one specific interface in that 1 specific AZ.

PrivateDNS (Enabled by Default)
	\- associates a Route53 Private Hosted Zone with your VPC.
	\- overrides the Default DNS for services with a new version that points at your Interface Endpoint.
	\- applications can use Interface Endpoints without being modified.

## VPC Peering

* VPC Peering is a service that lets you create a private and encrypted network link between 2 VPCs.
* 1 Peering connection links 2, and only 2, VPCs.
* Works for VPCs in the Same Region/Cross-Region and the VPCs can be in the Same Account/Cross-Account.
* Upon creating a VPC Peer, you can enable an option so that Pubic Hostnames of services resolve to Private IPs (Optional).
* If VPCs are in the same region, then they can reference each other using Security Group IDs.
* VPC Peering does not support Transitive Peering.
* To fully configure connectivity between hose VPCs, you need Routing Configurations, SGs and NACLs can filter.

**Architecture**

![[Pasted image 20240818170757.png]]

* VPC Peering connections cannot be created when there is an overlap in the VPC CIDRs.
* Routing isn’t Transitive.
* Communication is encrypted and transits over the AWS Global Network when using Cross-Region peering connections.

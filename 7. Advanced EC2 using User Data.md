## Bootstrapping EC2 using User Data

* Allows for EC2 build automation.
* Bootstrapping is enabled using EC2 user data which is injected into the instance via the meta-data IP (http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data).
* Anything you pass in User Data is executed by the instance OS.
* Executes only Once at the First Initial Launch.
* If you update the User Data and restart an instance, it will not execute it again.
* EC2 doesn’t interpret the data, the instance OS needs to understand the User Data.

Bootstrapping
	\- a process where scripts or other bits of configuration can be run when an instance is first launched.
	\- bringing an instance into service in a certain pre-configured state.

User Data
	\- a piece of information that you can pass into an EC2 instance.
	\- procedural as it is simply a script.

**Bootstrapping Architecture:**

**User Data Key Points**

* It’s opaque to EC2 as it considers it just as a block of data.
* It’s not secure meaning don’t use it for passwords or long term credentials (ideally).
* User Data is limited to 16KB in size (for anything more than that pass in a script that downloads that data).
* Can be modified when instance stopped, but only executed once at launch.

![Advanced EC2 using User Data-07-21-2024-1](images/Advanced%20EC2%20using%20User%20Data-07-21-2024-1.png)

Boot-Time-To-Service-Time
	\- metric of how quickly you can bring an instance into service.

Post Launch Time
	\- the time required after launch for you to perform manual or automatic configuration before the instance is ready for service.

## Enhanced Bootstrapping with CFN-INIT

AWS::CloudFormation::Init
	\- a way that you can pass complex bootstrapping instruction into an EC2 instance.
	\- provided with directives via Metadata.

cfn-init
	\- a helper script which is installed on EC2 Operating Systems.
	\- Simple Configuration Management System
	\- can be Procedural or Desired State.
	\- can be configured to watch for updates to the metadata on an object in a template, and if that metadata changes cfn-init can be executed again to update that instance.

**cfn-init Architecture**
![Advanced EC2 using User Data-07-21-2024-2](images/Advanced%20EC2%20using%20User%20Data-07-21-2024-2.png)

CloudFormation CreationPolicy
	\- added to a logical resource inside a CloudFormation template.
	\- you create it and you supply a timeout value.
	\- if CloudFormation does not receive any update with regards to the status after the timeout value it returns an error.

CloudFormation Signal (cfn-signal)
	\- reports to CloudFormation the success or not of the cfn-init bootstrapping.
	\- the Stack reports the status of the instance through report passed by the cfn-signal which refers to the cfn-init.

## EC2 Instance Roles

* Allows the EC2 service to assume an IAM Role.

![Advanced EC2 using User Data-07-21-2024-3](images/Advanced%20EC2%20using%20User%20Data-07-21-2024-3.png)

Instance Profile
	\- allows the permissions to get inside the instance.
	\- this Profile is attached to the EC2 instance not the Instance Role itself.
	\- has the same name as the Instance Role if created via AWS Console.

* Temporary Credentials are delivered via instance meta-data.
* Temporary Credentials in the EC2 instance are always renewed before they expire.

**Key Concepts:**

* Credentials are delivered via meta-data (iam/security-credentas/role-name).
* Automatically rotated so they are always valid.
* Should always use roles rather than adding access into instance.
* CLU tools will use ROLE credentials automatically.**

## AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Parameter Store

* Parameter Store is a regional and public service.
* Parameter store lets you create parameters, and these have a parameter name and parameter value.
* Value is the part that stores actual configuration.
* Many AWS services integrate with the Parameter Store natively.
* Allows you to store parameters using a hierarchical structure and also allows for versioning.
* Can store Plaintext and Ciphertext (KMS).
* Parameter Store also has the concept of Public Parameters (Publicly Available and Created by AWS).
* Any changes that occur to any parameters can spawn or create events.

**3 Different Type of Parameters you can store:**

1. Strings
	\- any string value.

2. StringLists
	\- strings separated by commas.

3. SecureStrings
	\- encrypt sensitive data using KMS keys from your account or another account.

**2 Types of Parameter Store Tiers:**

1. Standard (Free)
	\- store up to 10,000 parameters.
	\- with parameter value up to 4KB.
	\- no parameter policies and no sharing with other AWS accounts.

2. Advanced (Charges Apply)
	\- store up to 100,000 parameters.
	\- with parameter values up to 8KB.
	\- can add parameter policies and sharing with other AWS accounts.

**SSM Parameter Store Architecture**

## System and Application Logging on EC2

* CloudWatch is the product responsible for storing and managing metrics within AWS.
* CloudWatch Logs is a subset of CloudWatch aimed at storing, managing and visualizing any logging data.
* Neither can Natively capture any data inside an Instance.
* CloudWatch Agent is required to capture these custom metrics which needs configurations and permissions.

**Logging on EC2 Architecture**

![Advanced EC2 using User Data-07-21-2024-5](images/Advanced%20EC2%20using%20User%20Data-07-21-2024-5.png)

Agent Configuration
	\- configures the metrics and the logs that we want to capture which is then injected into CloudWatch using log groups.

## EC2 Placement Groups

**3 Types of Placement Groups in EC2**

1. Cluster
	\- designed to ensure that any instances in a single cluster placement group are physically close together.

2. Spread
	\- ensuring that instances are all using different underlying hardware.
	\- keep instances separated.

3. Partition
	\- designed for distributed and replicated applications which have infrastructure awareness.
	\- group of instances spread on different hardware (Host).

**Cluster Placement Groups**
	\- used when you want to achieve the absolute highest level of performance possible within EC2.
	\- launch the instances that will be in the group all at the same time.
	\- ensures that AWS allocate capacity for everything that you require.
	\- launched into a single Availability Zone.
	\- generally use the same rack but often the same EC2 host.
	\- 10Gbps p/stream
	\- Lowest latency possible and max Packets Per Second (PPS) possible in AWS.

**Cluster Architecture**

![Advanced EC2 using User Data-07-21-2024-6](images/Advanced%20EC2%20using%20User%20Data-07-21-2024-6.png)

**Key Concepts for Cluster Placement Groups**

* You cannot span multiple AZs with CPG. This is locked when launching the first instance.
* You can span VPC peers, but this can impact the performance.
* Requires a supported instance type.
* Generally use the same type of instance (Not Mandatory).
* Launch the instances at the same time (Not Mandatory, but Very Recommended).
* CPG offer 10Gbps of single string performance.
* Use Case: Performance, Fast Speeds, and Low Latency.


**Spread Placement Group**
	- designed to ensure the maximum amount of availability and resilience for an application.
	- can span multiple AZs
	- instances which are placed into a spread placement group are located on separate isolated infrastructure racks within each AZ.
	- has a limit of 7 instances per AZ - Isolated Infrastructure Limit.


**Spread Architecture**

![Advanced EC2 using User Data-07-21-2024-7](images/Advanced%20EC2%20using%20User%20Data-07-21-2024-7.png)

**Key Concepts for Spread Placement Groups**

* SPG provides infrastructure isolation.
* Each instance runs from a different rack which has its own network and power source.
* A limit 7 instance per AZ (Hard Limit)
* Use Case: Small number of critical instances that need to be kept separated from each other.


**Partition Placement Groups**
	\- designed for when you have infrastructure where you have more than 7 instances per AZ, but you still need the ability to separate those instances into separate fault domains.
	\- can be created across multiple AZs in a region.
	\- you specify a number of partitions with a maximum of 7 per AZ in that region.
	\- each partition has its own racks.
	\- you can launch as many instances as you need into the group and you can either select the partition explicitly or have EC2 make that decision on your behalf.
	\-  designed for huge scale parallel processing systems where you need to create groupings of instances and have them separated.

**Partition Architecture**

![Advanced EC2 using User Data-07-21-2024-8](images/Advanced%20EC2%20using%20User%20Data-07-21-2024-8.png)

**Key Concepts for Partition Placement Groups**

* 7 Partitions per AZ.
* Instances can be placed in a specific partition or allow EC2 to automatically place it for you.
* Great for Topology aware applications (HDFS, HBase, and Cassandra).
* Contain the impact of failure to part of an application.


## EC2 Dedicated Hosts

* An EC2 Host allocated to you and its entirety.
* You pay for the host itself which is designed for a specific family of instances.
* No instance charges.
* On-Demand & Reserved (1 or 3 year terms) Options are available.
* Host hardware comes with a certain number of physical sockets and cores.
	* Dictates how many instances can be run on that host.
	* Software which is license based on physical sockets or cores can utilize this visibility of the hardware.


**Default Dedicated Host Architecture**

![Advanced EC2 using User Data-07-21-2024-9](images/Advanced%20EC2%20using%20User%20Data-07-21-2024-9.png)

* Default way that dedicated hosts work is that hosts are designed for a specific family and size of instance.
* You can’t use different sizes of the same family of instances at the same time.

**Nitro Based Dedicated Host Architecture**

![Advanced EC2 using User Data-07-21-2024-10](images/Advanced%20EC2%20using%20User%20Data-07-21-2024-10.png)

* Offers more flexibility.
* You can use different sizes of instances at the same time up to your core limit.

**Limitations & Features**

* AMI Limits (Not Supported)
	* RHEL
	* SUSE Linux
	* Windows AMI
* Amazon RDS instances are not supported.
* Placement groups are not supported for Dedicated Hosts.
* Hosts can be shared with other AWS Organizations Accounts using Resource Access Manager (RAM).

Resource Access Manager
	\- a way that you can share certain AWS products and services between accounts.

## Enhanced Networking and EBS Optimized

Enhanced Networking
	\- a feature which is designed to improve the overall performance of EC2 networking.
	\- required for any high-end performance features such as Cluster Placement Groups.
	\- uses a technique call Single Root IO Virtualization (SR-IOV).

Single Root IO Virtualization (SR-IOV)
	\- Network Interface Card is virtualization aware.

**EC2 Host Architecture without SR-IOV in Networking**

![Advanced EC2 using User Data-07-21-2024-11](images/Advanced%20EC2%20using%20User%20Data-07-21-2024-11.png)

* Host presents NIC as a single Network Interface Card.

**EC2 Host Architecture with SR-IOV in Networking**

![Advanced EC2 using User Data-07-21-2024-12](images/Advanced%20EC2%20using%20User%20Data-07-21-2024-12.png)

* Host presents the single NIC it has as 2 Network Interface Cards.
* Higher I/O and consumes lower CPU resources on the host.
* Allows for more bandwidth (Higher PPS).
* Consistent lower latency.
* It’s either available by Default or available for no charge on most modern EC2 instance types.

EBS Optimized Instance
	\- an option that is set on a per instance basis.
	\- essentially adding dedicated capacity for storage networking to an EC2 instance.
	\- does not impact the data performance.
	\- most instances support it and have it enabled by default at no extra charge.
	\- some older instances support it, but enabling comes at an extra cost.

## Other EC2 Features

Hibernation
	\- allows applications to pick up exactly where they left off.
	\- reducing the startup time taken by applications, and saves effort in setting up the environment or applications all over again.

* It is not possible to Enable or Disable Hibernation once instance is launched.

Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)
	\- a network device that you can attach to your Amazon EC2 instance to accelerate High Performance Computing (HPC) and machine learning applications.
	\- has OS-bypass capabilities.
	\- provides lower and more consistent latency and higher throughput than the TCP transport.

* OS-bypass is not supported on Windows Instances.

Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)
	\- similar to EFA without the OS-bypass.

## Database Refresher & Models

* Databases are systems which store and manage data.

Relational Database
	\- has structure in and between tables of data or a Rigid Schema (defined in advance).
	\- fixed relationship between tables.
	\- key component of any SQL based DB system is a table.

Structured Query Language (SQL)
	\- a language used for to store, update, and retrieve data.
	\- a feature of most Relational Database Platforms.

Schema
	\- a structure of a database table.

Non-Relation Database
	\- more relaxed Schema.
	\- relationships between tables are handled differently.

NoSQL
	\- everything which does not fit into the SQL mold.

**Relational Database Structure**

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024.png)

* Columns are Attributes
* Rows are Attribute Values.
* Data which relates together is stored within a table.
* Every attribute has to have a value.

Primary Key
	\- unique identifier value for a table.

Composite Key
	\- can be found in a join table.
	\- a key form of two or more parts.
	\- when combined together they have to be unique.
	\- used when there is no single key or attribute (i.e no primary keys)available to find unique rows in a table.

Foreign Key
	\- a field (or a set of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table

**Non-Relational Database Structure**

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-1](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-1.png)

**Key-Value Database**

* Contain sets of keys and values.
* As long as every single key is unique the value does not matter.
* Used for in-memory caching.
* No real Schema.
* Does not have any real structure.
* Scalable and fast.

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-2](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-2.png)

**Wide Column Store**

* Each row or item has one or more keys (Partition Key and Additional or Range or Sort Key).
* Every item in the table needs to have the same key layout.
* Keys need to be unique to only that table.
* Offers groupings of items called Tables.
* Every item can have different attributes.
* Does not require every attribute to have a value.

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-3](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-3.png)

**Document**

* Designed to store and query data as documents.
* Formatted using a structure like XML or JSON.
* Ideal for interacting with whole documents or deep attribute interactions.
* Each document has a unique ID, and the database has access to the structure inside the document.
* Flexible indexing.

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-4](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-4.png)

**Column Store (Redshift)**

* Columns are stored together.
* Ideal for reporting or when all values for a specific attribute (size) are required.

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-5](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-5.png)

**Row Store (MySQL) (Relational DB) (For Comparison Only With Column Store)**

* Where you interact with data based on rows.
* Ideal when you are operating with rows.
* Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) Databases.

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-6](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-6.png)

**Graph**

* Relationship between things are formally defined and stored in the databases itself along with the data.
* Good for relationship driven data.

Nodes
	\- objects or nouns within a Graph Database.
	\- can have properties which have simple key value pairs of data which are attached to Nodes.

Edges
	\- relationship connecting it to other Nodes.
	\- have a name and a direction.

* Relationships can also have attached data like name value pairs.

## ACID vs BASE

* ACID and BASE are database transaction models.

Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerant (Resilience) CAP Theorem
	\- states that any database product is only capable of delivering a maximum of two of these different factors.

1. Consistency
	\- means that every read to a database will receive the most recent write or it will get an error.

2. Availability
	\- every request will receive a non-error response but without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write and that’s important.

3. Partition Tolerance
	\- the system can be made of multiple network partitions, and the system continues to operate even if there are a number of dropped messages or errors between these network nodes.

* ACID focuses on Consistency.
* BASE focuses on Availability.

**ACID**

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-7](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-7.png)

* Generally refers to any of the RDS Databases.

1. Atomic
	\- ensures that either all parts of a transaction is successful or no part is successful.

2. Consistent
	\- transactions move the database from one valid state to another.
	\- nothing in-between is allowed.

3. Isolated
	\- if multiple transactions occur at once, they don’t interfere with each other.

4. Durable
	\- once a transaction has been committed, it will remain remain committed even in the case of a system failure.
	\- transactions stored on non-volatile memory, resilient to power outages, or crashes.

**BASE**

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-8](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-8.png)

1. Basically Available
	- read and write operations are available “as much as possible”, but without any consistency guarantees.
	- replicates data across all of the different nodes of that database.

2. Soft State
	- does not enforce consistency as this responsibility is offloaded onto the application/user.
	- data can have transient or temporary states that may change over time

3. Eventually Consistent
	- record will achieve consistency when all the concurrent updates have been completed.

**Shortcuts**

* ACID = RDS Database
* BASE = NoSQL Style Database
* NoSQL or DynamoDB with ACID = DynamoDB Transactions

## Databases on EC2

**Why you might do it:**

* Access to the DB instance OS (OS Level Access).
* Advanced DB Option tunings (Root Level Access or DBRoot).
* Vendor demands
* Run a DB or DB Version that AWS doesn’t provide.
* Specific OS/DB combination that AWS doesn’t provide.
* Architecture AWS doesn’t provide.

**Why you shouldn’t:**

* Admin Overhead of managing EC2 and DB Host/Instances.
* Backups and Disaster Recovery Management are more complex.
* EC2 and EBS volumes are only AZ resilient.
* Features of AWS DB products are better than what you can achieve alone.
* EC2 does not have any concept of serverless. More difficult to scale.
* Replication
* Performance is much better on AWS DB services.

## Relational Database Service (RDS) Architecture

* RDS provides a managed version of a database server.
* No access to the OS or SSH access for the most part.
* Runs within a VPC.

**Choice of Database Engines**

* MySQL
* MariaDB
* PostgreSQL
* Oracle
* Microsoft SQL Server

Amazon Aurora
	\- a custom database engine and product created by AWS.

RDS Custom
	\- a variant of RDS where do have some more low-level access.

**RDS Architecture**

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-9](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-9.png)

* RDS creates a primary instance and a standby instance.
* RDS can be access from the VPC or any connected private networks (VPN or Direct Connect).
* RDS can also be configured with public addressing allowing access from the public internet.
* RDS instances can have multiple databases on them.
* Every RDS instance has its own dedicated storage provided by EBS.
* Using Multi-AZ allow the primary instances to replicate to the standby instances using synchronous replication.

RDS Subnet Group
	\- list of subnets that RDS can use within the VPC.

Synchronous Replication
	\- data is received by the Standby DB instance as soon as it is received by the Primary DB Instance.
	\- standby will have the same set of data as the primary.

Read Replicas
	\- use asynchronous replication.
	\- can be in the same region or different regions.
	\- used to scale read load or to add layers of resilience if you ever need to recover in a different AWS region.
 
RDS Costs

* Instance Size and Type (Hourly rate, but billed per second)
* Multi AZ or Not
* Storage Type and amount (Per GB monthly fee for storage)
* Data Transfer (per GB of data transfer in and out of your DB instance)
* Backups and Snapshots (e.g. 2TB of storage = 2TB of Snapshot for free beyond that there is a cost)
* Licensing for commercial DB Engines

## Relational Database Service (RDS) Multi AZ - Instance and Cluster

**RDS - Multi AZ - Instance**

* RDS has a primary database instance containing any databases you create.
* The Primary instance is configured to replicate its data Synchronously to 1 Standby (running in another AZ) replica.
* Replication is at a storage level.
* All accesses to the database are via the database CNAME.
* You always access the Primary DB Instance. No access to the Standby.
* Backups can occur from the Standby Instance.

**Limitations:**

* Not Free Tier.
* Only 1 Standby Replica Instance.
* Multi AZ mode can only be within the same region.

CNAME
	\- a DNS name that by default points to the Primary DB Instance.

**Primary Instance Architecture**

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-10](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-10.png)

**Failover to Standby Instance Architecture (60-120 seconds of Failover)**

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-11](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-11.png)

**Key Concepts**

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-12](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-12.png)

**RDS - Multi AZ - Cluster**

* RDS is capable of having 1 Writer Instance replicate to 2 Reader (in another AZ) Instances.
* Writer Instance replicates Synchronously to the Reader Instances.
* While data is sent to the Writer and it’s viewed as being committed when at least one of the Readers confirms that it has been written.
* Runs on much faster hardware (Graviton + NVME SSD then flushed to EBS).**

Committed
	\- when data has been sent and stored to the Writer Instance and it has been replicated to at least 1 Reader.
	\- means that the transaction has been completed successfully and the data changes have been written to the database storage.

**Limitations:**

* Only 2 Reader Instances.
* 35 seconds of Failover + Transactions Log application.

Transaction Logs
	\- store the actual operations executed on the DB. 

Writer Instance
	\- acts as the Primary Instance.
	\- can be used for both Read and Write operations.

Reader Instance
	\- replicas that can be used only for Read operations.

**Endpoints Types:**

1. Cluster Endpoint
	\- like the database CNAME.
	\- it primarily points at the Writer Instance for Read and Write operations or administration functions.

2. Reader Endpoint
	\- this points at any available Reader Instance within the cluster which sometimes also include the Writer Instance.
	\- generally this points to dedicated Reader Instances.

3. Instance Endpoint
	\- not recommended to be used directly as it cannot tolerate instance failure as it only points to 1 specific instance.
	\- points at specific instance.
	\- generally used for Testing/Fault Finding.

**Multi AZ Cluster Architecture**

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-13](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-13.png)

**Key Concepts**

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-14](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-14.png)

## RDS Automatic Backup, RDS Snapshots and Restore

**2 Types of Backup Like Functionality:**

* Both are stored in S3, but they use AWS managed buckets.
* Backups are taken from Standby Instance (if Multi AZ is Enabled).
* Backups are taken of the instance meaning all DBs within the instance not just a specific one.

1. Automated Backups
	\- occur once per day.
	\- acts like an automated snapshot (First backup = Full & Next = Increments).
	\- every 5 minutes DB Transaction Logs are also written to S3.
	\- these backups are automatically cleared up by AWS.
	\- you can set a retention period from 0 to 35 days.

Transaction Logs
	\- store the actual operations executed on the DB.

* When deleting the DB you can still choose to retain any automated backups, but they still expire based on the retention period.

2. Snapshots
	\- not automatic as you need to run explicitly or via script or custom application.
	\- function like EBS Snapshots.
	\- first Snapshot if the whole DB instance, then succeeding are increments/changes of it.
	\- does not expire and requires you to clear it up if needed (lives past the lifecycle of the DB instance).
	\- more frequent snapshots = lower RPO 

**RDS - Backups - General**

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-15](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-15.png)

**Cross Region Backups**

* RDS also allows you to replicate backups (Snapshots & Transaction Logs) to another AWS region.
* Charges apply for the Cross-Region Data Copy and any Storage used in the destination region.
* This is not enabled by default in Automated Backups.

**RDS Restores**

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-16](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-16.png)

* RDS creates a new RDS instance when you restore an Automated Backup or Manual Snapshot.
* Requires updating application to use new DB endpoints.
* You are restoring with Snapshots, the DB to the time the backup was created (single point in time). 
* Automated Backups offers lower RPO (any 5 minute point in time).

## RDS Read-Replicas

Read Replicas
	\- are read-only replicas of an RDS instance.
	\- you can use read replicas, but only for Read operations.
	\- kept in sync using Asynchronous Replication.

* Can be created in the Same Region as the Primary DB Instance or in other AWS regions (Cross Region Read Replicas).
* Read Replicas can have their own Read Replicas.
* Read Replicas can be “promoted” meaning you’re able to use them as a normal RDS instance.

Asynchronous Replication
	\- data is written to the Primary Instance, at which point it is viewed as committed, then it’s replicated to read replicas.

Committed
	\- means that the transaction has been completed successfully and the data changes have been written to the database storage.

**Importance of Read Replicas:**

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-17](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-17.png)

1. Read Performance and Read Scaling
	\- you can create 15 Direct Read Replicas per DB instance except for Oracle DB Engine (Maximum of 5).
	\- provides additional read performance.
	\- read replicas can have own read replicas (but lag becomes a problem).
	\- global performance improvements.

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-18](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-18.png)

2. RPO/RTO Improvements
	- Snapshots and Backups improve Recovery Point Objective (RPO).
	- RR’s offer a near 0 RPO.  
	- RRs are read only until promoted.

Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
	\- maximum amount of data that can be lost after a recovery disaster.

Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
	\- the maximum acceptable amount of time for restoring a network or application and regaining access to data after an unplanned disruption.

## RDS Data Security

* SSL/TLS (in transit) is available for RDS (can be set as Mandatory on a per user basis).
* Encryption at rest is supported in different ways depending on the engine.
* By default, encryption is supported using KMS and EBS Encryption which is handled by the Host and EBS.
* If KMS is used, you can use a AWS Managed Customer Master Key (CMK) or Customer Managed CMK which generates DEKs.
* Encryption cannot be removed once added.
* RDS MSSQL and Oracle support Transparent Data Encryption (TDE).
* RDS Oracle also support TDE using CloudHSM.

Transparent Data Encryption
	\- encryption which is supported and handled within the DB engine itself.

**RDS KMS Encryption & TDE Architecture**

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-19](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-19.png)

**RDS IAM Authentication**

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-20](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-20.png)

* RDS can make use of IAM Authentication through the Local DB account.
* Configure Local DB account to use AWS Authentication Token/s.
* Attach a policy to Users or Roles that maps IAM Identity onto the Local RDS (DB) User/account.

generate-db-auth-token
	\- creates a token with a 15 minutes validity which can be used in place of a DB User Password.

* Authorization is still controlled by the DB engine not IAM.

Enhanced Monitoring in RDS
	\- uses an agent on the DB instance for RDS DB monitoring of various metrics (e.g. CPU bandwidth, and total memory consumed).

* Data modifying events (Insert, Delete, and Update) are not captured by RDS events.

## RDS Custom

* RDS Custom fills the gap between the main RDS product and EC2 running a DB engine.
* OS/Engine access is limited using the main RDS product.
* DB engine on EC2 requires more admin overhead.

RDS Custom
	\- it gives you the ability to occupy the middle ground where you can utilize RDS, but still get access to some of the customization that you have access when running a DB engine on EC2.
	\- works on MS SQL and Oracle.
	\- can connect using SSH, RDP, and Session Manager.

* You will be able to see the EC2 Instance, EBS Volume/s, and Backups inside your AWS account.
* Customization of RDS Custom can be done through the DB Automation Settings.
	* Pause DB Automation to counter disruptions.
	* Then resume after configuring RDS Custom.

**RDS Custom Responsibility Model**

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-21](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-21.png)

## Amazon Aurora Architecture

**Aurora Key Differences**

* Aurora is a fully managed RDB engine that’s compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL.
* Makes use of the base entity of a Cluster.
* Made up of a 1 Primary Instance and 0 or more Replicas.
	* Replicas within Aurora can be used for Reads during normal operation.
* Aurora uses a Shared Cluster Volume instead of a local storage for its compute instance.
* Replicas can be used for Failover scenarios.
* Can have up to 15 Replicas (Any can be the Failover Target).

Cluster Volume
	\- storage that shared and available to all compute instances within a Cluster.

**Aurora Storage Architecture**

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-22](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-22.png)

* Storage has a minimum of 10GB maximum size of 128TB.
* It also has 6 Replicas across Multiple AZs
* When data is written to the Primary Instance, Aurora Synchronously replicates that data across all of these 6 storage nodes.
* Spread across the AZs which are associated with your Cluster.
* All instances have access to these storage nodes.
* Aurora automatically detects failure in the disk volumes that make up the shared Cluster Storage.

**Key Concepts**

* Cluster Shared Volume is SSD based (High IOPS & Low Latency).
* Storage is billed on what is used.
* Storage freed up can be reused.
* Replicas can be added or removed without requiring storage provisioning.

High Water Mark
	\- billed for the most used (e.g. if you consume 50GB of storage this month, and then next month 40GB you are still billed 50GB for that month).

**Endpoints**

1. Cluster Endpoints
	- always points to the Primary Instance.
	- used for both Read and Write operations.

2. Reader Endpoint
	- will only point at the Primary Instance if it is the only that exists.
	- if there are replicas then it will load balance across all available replicas.

3. Custom Endpoint

4. Instance Unique Endpoint

**Cost**

* No Free Tier
* Aurora doesn’t support Micro Instances.
* Beyond RDS Single AZ (Micro) Aurora offers better value.
* Compute has an hourly charge, and you’re billed per second with a 10 minute minimum.
* Storage is billed based on a GB month consumed metric, and IO cost per request.
* 100% DB size in backups are included.

**Aurora Restore, Clone & Backtrack**

* Backups in Aurora work the same way in RDS.
* Restores create a new Cluster.
* Fast clones make a new database from an existing database much faster than copying all the data (copy-on-write).

Backtrack
	\- can be used which allow in-place rewinds to a previous point in time of up to 72 hours (needs to be Enabled on a per Cluster basis).

Fast Clones
	\- it references the original DB and it only stores any differences between the two.
	\- changes like updates to the original database or updates to the database of the clone are save to the each other.

Aurora Native Function
	\- allows you to invoke an AWS Lambda from an Aurora MySQL DB cluster.

## Aurora Serverless

* Aurora Serverless uses the concept of Aurora Capacity Units (ACU).
* You can set Minimum and Maximum ACU values that the Aurora Serverless will scale between.
* Cluster adjusts on load and can even go down to 0 (paused).
* Consumption billing is on a per second basis.
* Same resilience as Aurora (6 copies across AZs)

Aurora Capacity Units (ACU)
	\- represent a certain amount of compute and a corresponding amount of memory.
	\- stateless and shared across AWS customers.
	\- 1 ACU = 2GiB of memory

Share Proxy Fleet
	\- broker a connection between the application and Aurora Capacity Units.

**Aurora Serverless Architecture**
![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-23](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-23.png)

**Use Case:**

* Infrequently used application.
* New applications
* Variable workloads
* Unpredictable workloads
* Development and Test databases
* Multi-tenant applications

## Aurora Global Database

Global Database
	\- allows you to create Global Level Replication using Aurora from a Master region to up to 5 Secondary AWS regions.
	\- RPO of 1 second and RTO of less than 1 minute.

**Aurora Global Database Architecture**

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-24](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-24.png)

* The entire Secondary Cluster in the Secondary regions are Read only.
* Write operations can be done to the Primary Instance in the Primary Region.
* Read operations can be done to the Replicas in both the Primary and Secondary Regions.
* 1 second replication time between the Primary region and secondary regions.

**Use Case:**

* Cross-Region Disaster Recover and Business Continuity.
* Global Read Scaling.
* 1s or less replication between regions (One Way Replication).
* No impact on DB performance.
* Secondary regions can have 16 replicas.
* Replicas can be promoted to Read and Write.
* A Maximum of 5 Secondary Regions.

## Aurora Multi-Master Writes 

**Single Master Setup**

* Default Aurora mode is Single Master.

Single Master
	\- 1 Read Write Instance and 0 or more Read only Replicas.

Cluster Endpoint
	\- used to read or write operations.

Read Endpoint
	\- used for load balancing reads across any of the read only replicas.


**Multi Master Setup**
	\- all of the instances by default are capable of both Read and Write operations.

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-25](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-25.png)

* This feature allows an Aurora Cluster to have multiple instances which are capable of performing both Read and Writes.
* No Cluster Endpoint to use an application is responsible for connecting to instances within the Cluster.
* No load balancing across instance with the Multi Master Cluster, the application connects to one or all of the instances in the Cluster.
* To commit a change in the Database a Quorum of nodes need to agree of the change.
* In case there is a conflict the current change it can be rejected by all nodes.
* Changes are replicated to other nodes in the Cluster.

## Relational Database Service (RDS) Proxy

* Instead of your application connecting to a database every time they use it, they connect to the proxy which maintains a pool of connections to the database.
* Any connections to the proxy can use this already established pool of DB connections.

**RDS Proxy Architecture**

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-26](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-26.png)

* Proxy runs only from within a VPC.
* Oracle is the only DB engine that does not support this.
* Proxy maintains a long term connection pool.
* RDS Proxy allows DB connections to be reused which avoids the lag of establishment, usage & termination of each invocation.
* Abstracts clients away from DB failure or failover events.
* Proxy connection is established and waits even if Target DB is unresponsive.

**Key Concepts**

* RDS proxy is a fully managed DB proxy for RDS and Aurora.
* It’s auto-scaling and highly available by Default.
* Provides connection pooling.
* RDS Proxy is only accessible from within a VPC.
* Access via Proxy Endpoint.
* Can enforce SSL/TLS connection.
* Abstracts the failure of a DB.

Too Many Connections Error
	\- it means all available connections are in use by other clients.

## Database Migration Service (DMS)

* A Managed Database Migration Service.
* Starts with a Replication Instance running on EC2, which runs 1 or more replication tasks.
* You need to define a Source (Source DB Endpoint) and Destination (Target DB Endpoint) Endpoints.

Restriction:

* One of the Endpoints must be running within AWS.

**DMS Architecture**

![Relational Database Service (RDS)-07-24-2024-27](images/Relational%20Database%20Service%20(RDS)-07-24-2024-27.png)

Replication Task
	\- defines all of the options relating to the migration.
	\- essentially moves data from the Source DB to the Target DB.

**3 Types of Migration Jobs**

1. Full Load
	\- one off migration of all data.

2. Full Load + Change Data Capture (CDC)
	\- migrates existing data and also replicates any ongoing changes from the Source.

3. CDC Only
	\- designed to replicate only data changes.
	\- alternative methods are using native tooling of the respective DB.

* DMS does not natively support any method of Schema Conversion, but there is a dedicated tool in AWS called Schema Conversion Tool (SCT).

Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)
	\- to perform Schema Modification or conversion between DB Engines/version.
	\- only used when converting one DB engine to another.
	\- not used when migrating between compatible DB types.
	\- works with OLTP Databases.
	\- works with OLAP Databases.

* Large migrations can be multi-TB in size.
*  It is not optimal to do migrations of that quantity over the network.
* DMS can utilize Snowball range of products.

## Virtualization 101

* EC2 provides virtualization as a service and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

Virtualization
- the process of running more than one Operating System on a piece of physical hardware or server.

**Before or Without Virtualization Architecture**

![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024.png)

* Operating System (OS) or a part of an OS, which is the Kernel, runs in a special level of access known to the hardware known as a Privileged mode.
* Kernel is the only part of the software that is able to interact with the hardware.
* Applications run in user mode or unprivileged mode.
* Applications that need to interact with the hardware have to go through the OS and make a System Call.

**Virtualization Architecture**

* A single piece of hardware running multiple Operating Systems.
* Each OS is a separate instance in that single hardware.

**2 Types of Software Virtualization:**

![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024-1](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024-1.png)

1. Emulated Virtualization
	\- it included an additional capability known as a Hypervisor.
	\- software ran in privileged mode.
	\- guest Operating Systems are wrapped container of sorts known as Virtual Machines with a virtual allocation of resources.
	\- Hypervisor performs Binary Translation 

![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024-2](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024-2.png)

2. Para-virtualization
	\- essentially almost the same setup, but has modified Operating Systems instead.
	\- modifies OS to replace privileged calls with user calls, but instead of calling on the hardware it calls on the Hypervisor or Hyper Calls.

![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024-3](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024-3.png)

3. Hardware Assisted Virtualization
	\- CPU and Memory itself has become virtualization aware.

4. Single Route IO Virtualization (SR-IOV)
	\- it allows any add-on card to present itself not as a single card, but almost several mini cards.
	\
Enhanced Networking
	\- the network performance is massively improved in EC2.
	\- faster speeds and consistent lower latency even at hight loads.

Nitro
	\- AWS’s own Hypervisor stack.

## EC2 Architecture and Resilience

* EC2 Instances are virtual machines (OS + Resources).
* EC2 Instances run on EC2 Hosts.
* Availability Zone resilient service.

Hosts
	\- physical service hardware that AWS manages.
	\- run in 1 Availability Zone.

**2 Types of Hosts:**

1. Shared Hosts (Default)
	\- hosts that is shared across different AWS customers.
	\- no ownership of the hardware.
	\- you pay for the individual instances.
	\- even if you use Shared Hosts you are still isolated from other customers.

2. Dedicated Hosts
	\- you are paying for the entire hosts (server).
	\- dedicated use to your account alone.

**EC2 Architecture**

![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024-4](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024-4.png)

Instance Store
	\- it is a temporary block-level storage for your instance.
	\- if the instance moves off this host to another one, then that storage is lost.

**2 Types of Networking**

1. **Storage Networking**
2. **Data Networking**

* Instances can have multiple network interfaces even in different subnets as long as they’re in the same Availability Zone.
* When instances are provisioned in a specific subnet of a VPC a primary Elastic Network Interface is provisioned in a subnet, which maps to the physical hardware on the EC2 host.
* EC2 can connect to an Elastic Block Store (EBS).

Elastic Block Store (EBS)
	\- EBS also runs inside a specific Availability Zone.
	\- you cannot access them cross zone.
	\- lets you allocate volumes of persistent storage which can be allocated to instances in the same Availability Zone.
	\- network based storage product in AWS.

**Instances stay on a host until one of two things happen:**

* The instance will be relocated to another host in the same Availability Zone if one of these two happens.
* Instance cannot natively move between Availability Zones.
* Restarting an instance does not move it into another host.

1. The host fails or is taken down for maintenance.
2. If an instance is stopped and then started, which is different than just restarting.

Migration
	\- taking a copy of an instance and making a brand new one in a different Availability Zone.

* You cannot connect network interfaces or EBS located in one Availability Zone to an EC2 instance located in another.

What’s EC2 Good For

* Traditional OS and Application Compute needs.
* Great long-running compute needs.
* Server style applications.
* Applications with either burst or steady-state load requirements.
* Monolithic application stack.
* For migrating application workloads or Disaster Recovery.
* EC2 tends to be the Default compute service

## EC2 Instance Types

* Raw amount of resources you get (CPU, Memory, Storage & Type).
* Resource ratios as some instance give you more of one, but less of the other.
* Instance type also influences the network type for storage and data networking capability that you get.
* System Architecture / Vendor (Intel/AMD, ARM64/x86)
* Additional Features and Capabilities.

**General Purpose (Default)**
	\- diverse workloads as there is equal resource ratio.

**Compute Optimized (CPU)**
	\- for Media Processing, HPC, Scientific Modeling, gaming, Machine Learning.
	\- for CPU intensive processes.

**Memory Optimized (RAM)**
	\- processing large in-memory datasets, caching, some database workloads.
	\- workloads that require a large amount of RAM for multi-tasking, or processing.**

**Accelerated Computing (GPU)**
	\- dedicated hardware GPU, file programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).
	\- for high scale parallel processing, and modeling.

**Storage Optimized**
	\- provide large amounts of super-fast local storage, either designed for high sequential rates or to provide massive amounts of IO operations per second.
	\- sequential and random IO, scale-out transactional databases, data warehousing, Elasticsearch, analytics workloads.

Decoding EC2 Types

R5dn.8xlarge

R - Instance Family (e.g. T Family, M Family, & etc)
5 - Instance Generation
dn - Additional Capabilities (e.g. a = AMD CPU, d = NVMe Storage, n = Network Optimized & etc)
8xlarge - Instance Size (e.g. nano to 8XL and onwards)

## Storage Refresher

Direct Attached
	\- storage on the EC2 host.
	\- physical disks connected directly to a device.
	\- storage is lost if EC2 is moved from hosts, or hardware failure.

Network Attached Storage
	\- volumes delivered over the network with Elastic Block Store (EBS)
	\- in on-premises environment, this uses mainly protocols ISCSI, or fiber channel.

Ephemeral Storage
	\- temporary storage
	\- Instance Store

Persistent Storage
	\- permanent storage
	\- lives on past the lifetime of the instance.
	\- EBS is a good example for this.

**3 Main Categories of Storage in AWS**

1. Block Storage
	\- a collection of addressable blocks presented either logically, as a volume, or as a blank physical hard drive.
	\- volume presented to the OS as a collection of blocks, without any structure provided.
	\- Mountable and bootable
	\- OS creates a file system (NTFS or ext3).
	\- can be encrypted using KMS.

* Most OS uses an EBS volume to boot off from or as a boot volume.

2. File Storage
	\- provided as a ready made file system, with a structure that is already there created by the OS.
	\- Mountable but not Bootable.

3. Object Storage
	\- has no structure, but just a flat collection on objects.
	\- an object can be anything.
	\- not mountable nor bootable.
	\- to retrieve an object you generally have to provide a key.

**Storage Performance**

![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024-6](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024-6.png)

1. IO (Block) Size
	\- the amount of data read or written in one operation.

2. Input-Output Operations Per Second (IOPS)
	\- how many read/write operations a storage system can perform per second.

3. Throughput
	\- the amount of data transferred in a given period, usually measured in megabytes per second (MB/s) or gigabytes per second (GB/s).
	\- IO Size x IOPS = Throughput

## Elastic Block Store

* A service which provides Block Storage.
* Can be unencrypted or encrypted using KMS.
* Instances see a block device and create a file system on this block device (ext3/4, xfs)
* EBS is Availability Zone resilient as it is only provisioned in one Availability Zone.
* EBS replicates within an AZ. Failure of an AZ means failure of a volume.
* Generally attaches to one EC2 instance (or other service) over a storage network.
* Can be detached from one instance, and reattached to another.
* EBS Volumes are not linked to the instance life cycle of one instance as it is persistent until you delete that EBS Volume.
* Supports live configuration changes while in production which means that you can modify the volume type, volume size, and IOPS capacity without service interruptions.

Multi-Attach
	\- lets you attach EBS to multiple EC2 instances at the same time, and this is used for clusters.
	\- cluster application manages it to avoid overwriting data and data corruption.
	\- can only be enabled on EBS Provisioned IOPS io1 or io2 volumes.

Snapshot
	\- backup an EBS Volume into S3.
	\- create volume from snapshot when migrating between AZs.
	\- snapshots in S3 are regionally resilient.

Billing

* Gigabyte per month metric but performance in some cases.

EBS Architecture Sample
![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024-7](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024-7.png)

Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon DLM)
	\- automate the creation, retention, and deletion of snapshots taken to back up your Amazon EBS volumes.
	\- reduce storage costs by deleting outdated backups

## EBS Volume Types - General Purpose (GP) SSD

GP2
	\- first iteration
	\- it can be as small as 1GB or as large as 16TB.
	\- created with an IO credit allocation.
	\- can burst up to 3,000 IOPS.
	\- maximum IOPS for GP2 is 16,000.

![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024-8](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024-8.png)

* An IO is 1 input output operation.
* IO Credit is a 16KB chunk of data.
* An IOP is one chunk of 16 kilobytes in one second.
* 1 IOPS is 1 IO in 1 second.

**Key Concepts:**

* IO Credit Buckets start off full. All volumes get an initial 5.4 Million IO credits which is 30 minutes at 3,000 IOPS.
* If you have no credits in this IO bucket, you can’t perform any IO on the disc
* IO bucket has a capacity of 5.4 million IO credits, and it fills at the baseline performance rate of the volume.
* Bucket fills with a minimum 100 IO Credits per second regardless of volume size.
* If you are consuming more credits than the rate at which your bucket is refilling, then you’re depleting the bucket.
* Consume less than the baseline performance to replenish your IO Credit Bucket.

Baseline Performance
	\- beyond the 100 minimum the bucket fills with 3 IO credits per second, per GB of volume size.
	\- a 100GB volume gets 300 IO credits as a baseline performance.

* Volumes which are up to 1TB in size, they use the IO Credit Architecture. 
* For Volumes larger than one 1TB, they have a baseline performance equal to or exceeding the burst rate of 3,000.

GP3
	\- default general purpose SSD based storage provided by EBS.
	\- removes the IO credit bucket architecture of GP2.
	\- every GP3 volume regardless of size starts with the standard 3,000 IOPS and transfer of 125MB per second.
	\- volume size can range from 1GB to 16TB.
	\- 20% cheaper than GP2.
	\- if you intend to use up to 3,000 IOPS this is the better option.
	\- extra cost for up to 16,0000 IOPS and up to 1,000 MB/s (vs 250MB/s max of GP2) of Throughput.
	\- performance above 3,000 IOPS does not get added automatically.

![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024-9](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024-9.png)

## EBS Volume Types - Provisioned IOPS (IO) SSD

* Configurable IOPS performance values that are independent of the size of the volume, and they’re designed for super high performance situations where consistent low latency is an important characteristic. 
* Multi-attach feature can only be enabled on EBS Provisioned IOPS IO volumes.
* Multi-attach feature only allows an EBS volume to be attached on multiple instances within an availability zone.

IO1 & IO2
	\- can achieve a maximum 64,000 IOPS per volume and 1000MB/s of Throughput.
	\- volume range of 4GB up to 16TB.

IO2 Block Express
	\- can achieve a maximum of 256,000 IOPS per volume and 4,000 MB/s of Throughput.
	\- volume range of 4GB to 64TB

**Maximum Size to Performance Ratio:**

* IO1 = 50 IOPS/GB (MAX)
* IO2 = 500 IOPS/GB (MAX)
* Block Express = 1000 IOPS/GB (MAX)

* You pay for both the size and the provisioned IOPS you need. 

Per Instance Performance Restriction
	\- different volumes have different maximum per instance performance level.
	\- type and size of the instance.

![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024-10](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024-10.png)

## EBS Volume Types - Hard Disk Drive (HDD) Based

![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024-11](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024-11.png)

1. ST1 - Throughput Optimized HDD
	\- fast HDD.
	\- cheaper than SSD volumes.
	\- ideal for larger volumes of data.
	\- for data which is written or read sequentially.
	\- volume range of 125GB to 16TB in size.
	\- maximum of 500 IOPS.
	\- IO on HDD volumes is measured as 1MB Blocks.
	\- 500 IOPS = 500MB/s Throughput
	\- follows a credit bucket architecture. 
	\- Performance Baseline of 40MB/s/TB
	\- Burst of 250MB/s/TB

Use case:
* Cost is a concern but you need frequent access storage for throughput intensive sequential workloads.
* Big data, data warehousing, and log processing.**

2. SC1 - Cold HDD
	\- designed for infrequent workloads.
	\- for just wanting to store lots of data without caring for performance.
	\- maximum of 250 IOPS (1MB IO Block Size).
	\- 250MB/s Throughput
	\- Performance Baseline of 12MB/s/TB
	\- Burst of 80MB/s/TB
	\- volume range of 125GB to 16TB.

3. Magnetic Volumes
	\- ideal for workloads where data are accessed infrequently, and applications where the lowest storage cost is important.
	\- this is a previous generation volume.

## Instance Store Volumes - Architecture

* Provide an Ephemeral Block Storage Devices.
* Temporary storage volumes essentially.
* Like EBS, but only local or physically connected instead of being presented over the network.
* Connected only to One EC2 Host.
* Instances which are on that Host can access those volumes.
* They’re locally attached so they offer the highest storage performance within AWS.
* Included in the price of any instances which they come with.
* Instance Store Volumes should be attached before or at launch time.

 
![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024-12](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024-12.png)

**Key Concepts:**

* Local or Physically connected to an EC2 host.
* Add at launch only.
* Lost on instance move, stopped state, terminations, resizing of instances, or hardware failure.
* Provides High Performance.
* Included in instance price.
* Temporary or Ephemeral Storage.

## Choosing between Instance Store & EBS

* Both have relatively High Performance offerings so it depends mainly on the needs.
* 260,000 is the maximum amount of IOPS per instance.
* There is a possibility of creating a RAID 0 set out of a combination of EBS volumes (Large Instance + Large EBS Volumes).

**Reason for choosing Elastic Block Store:**

* Persistence in storage.
* Resilience in storage.
* Storage isolation from instance lifecycles.

**Reasons for choosing Instance Store:**

* Super High Performance (for use cases that require more than 260,000 IOPS).
* Cost effective as Instance Store pricing is already included in the EC2 instance pricing itself.

![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024-13](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024-13.png)

## EBS Snapshots, Restore & Fast Snapshot Restore

* Snapshots are essentially backups of EBS volumes which is stored in S3.
* EBS Volumes are AZ resilient.
* Snapshots are incremental in nature. 
	* It means that the first Snapshot to be taken of a volume is a full copy of all of the data in that volume.
* Future snapshots are increment.
	* They only store the difference between the previous Snapshot and the state of the volume when the Snapshot is taken.
	* Each Snapshot even though incremental can be self-sufficient.
* Offers a great way to clone a volume.
* Snapshots can be copied to another AWS region.

**2 Ways of Creating an EBS Volume:**

1. Blank Volume
	\- creating from scratch.

2. From a Snapshot
	\- created or restored from Snapshots.

**EBS Snapshot Architecture**

![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024-14](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024-14.png)

**EBS Snapshot/Volume Performance**

* Creating a new EBS Volume without using a Snapshot, full performance is available immediately.
* Snapshots are restored lazily, meaning they are fetched gradually over time in the background.
* Requested blocks that have not been yet restored will be pulled from S3 immediately.
* You can force a read of every block of the volume.

Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)
	\- an option that you can set on a snapshot which makes it instantly restore.
	\- up to 50 FSR Snapshots per region.
	\- upon enabling it on a Snapshot you can pick specific Snapshot, and the AZs that you want to do instant restores to.
	\- 1 FSR set is a combination of a Snapshot and its AZ/s (e.g. 1 Snapshot with FSR to 4 different AZs = 4 FSR Sets / 50 FSR Sets per region).

**Snapshot Consumption and Billing**

![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024-15](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024-15.png)

* Gigabyte-month metric
* Charges only on used data not allocated data.

## EBS Encryption

* By default, no encryption is applied.
* Data stored in the EBS volume is in ciphertext.
* A Plaintext DEK is stored in memory of the EC2 Host for decryption of the ciphertext data in EBS.
* Encrypted using AES-256.
* EBS does not support Asymmetric KMS Keys.

**EBS Architecture without Encryption**

![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024-16](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024-16.png)

![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024-17](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024-17.png)

GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext
	\- an API call that generates and only gives the user an encrypted data encryption key.
	\- stored with the volume on the raw storage.

* When the EC2 instance moves from this host to another, the decrypted key is discarded leaving only the encrypted DEK with the EBS volume.
* If a snapshot is made of an encrypted EBS volume, the snapshot will also be encrypted with the same DEK used on the EBS volume.
* EBS volumes created from an encrypted snapshot will also be encrypted by the same DEK.

**Key Concepts:**

* AWS Accounts can be configured to encrypt EBS volumes by Default.
* You can set the default KMS key to use for this encryption or you can choose a KMS key to use manually each and every time.
* The KMS key is used to generate a per volume unique DEK.
* Snapshots & future volumes made from encrypted volumes/snapshots will use the same DEK.
* Can’t change a volume to NOT be encrypted. Once it’s encrypted, it’s encrypted.
* OS is not aware of the encryption therefore no performance loss.

Software Disk Encryption
	\- the OS does the encryption and stores the keys.
	\- you basically encrypt a file inside the OS in the instance.

**## EC2 Network & DNS Architecture**

* An EC2 instance always starts off with 1 Primary Elastic Network Interface (ENI) and if needed attach secondary ENIs, which can be in separate subnets, but within the same AZ.
* Attachment of Secondary ENIs depends on the type of instance you provision.

Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)
	\- have a Mac Address (Hardware Address).
	\- SGs are attached to ENIs.

- Enable/Disable Source/Destination Check per instance.
	* each ENI has a primary IPv4 Private Address (Does not change for the lifetime of the instance).
		* DNS Format: 
			* Private IPv4: 10.16.0.10
			* DNS: ip-10-16-0-10.ec2.internal 
	* 0 or more secondary IPs
	* 0 or 1 Public IPv4 Address (Changes upon stopping and starting of instance) (Dynamic)
		* DNS Format:
			* Public IPv4: 3.89.7.136
			* DNS: ec2-3-89-7-136.compute-1.amazonaws.com
		* Communications inside the VPC, it will use the Private IPv4, but outside the VPC it will use the Public IPv4.
	* 1 Elastic IP Address per private IPv4 address
		* when assigned to an instance the Dynamic Public IPv4 will be replaced by the Elastic IP.
	* 0 or more IPv6 addresses

Secondary ENI
	\- same with the Primary ENI except you can attach, detach, and move them to another EC2 instance.

Source/Destination Check
	\- if traffic is on the ENI, it’s going to be discarded if it’s not from one of the IP addresses on the ENI as a source or destination to one of the IP addresses on the ENI.

**EC2 Network & DNS Architecture**

![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024-18](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024-18.png)

![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024-19](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024-19.png)

* MAC Address is viewed as something static.
* Secondary ENI + MAC = Licensing
* Multi-homed (subnets) Management & Data
* Different Security Groups attached to different ENIs.
* OS does not see the Public IPv4.
* IPv4 Public IPs are Dynamic (Stop & Start Instance = Change Public IP).
* Public DNS = Private IP in VPC, and Public IP everywhere else.

## Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

* AMIs are the images of EC2.
* They are one way that you can create a template of an instance configuration.
* AMI’s can be used to launch EC2 instances.
* They can be AWS, Community, or Commercial/Marketplace (can include commercial software) provided AMI.
* AMIs are regional which means each Region hast its own set of AMIs with a unique ID (Format: ami-<random letters & numbers>).
* An AMI can only be used in the Region that it’s in.
* AMI also controls permissions of who or what has access to it. 
	* Public
	* Your Account (Default)
	* Specific Account
* You can create an AMI from an existing EC2 instance you want to template.

**AMI Lifecycle**

![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024-20](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024-20.png)

1. Launch
	\- create an instance using an AWS or Commercially provided AMI.

2. Configure
	\- apply custom configuration (e.g. install a set of applications, or install necessary EBS volumes)

3. Create Image
	\- upon creation of the AMI, any EBS volumes attached to the instance the AMI is based from will have a Snapshots created from those volumes.

Block Device Mapping
	\- essentially a table of data it links the snapshot ID that you created with when making the AMI.
	\- for each one of the snapshots of the EBS volumes it has a device ID linking/referencing back to the original EBS volumes attached to the base EC2 instance.

1. Launch
	- when creating a new instance using the custom AMI it will have same EBS volume configuration as the original.

**Key Concepts:**

* AMIs only works in one region meaning if you want to use it in another region you have to copy it to that region.
* AMI baking is the concept of creating an AMI from a configured instance and application.
* An AMI can’t be edited.
* Can be copied between Regions (includes its snapshots).
* You can share an AMI to another AWS Account or to an Organization/OUs.

## EC2 Purchase Options

**Priority Hierarchy:**

1. Reserved
2. On-Demand
3. Spot

![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024-21](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024-21.png)

**On-Demand (Default)**
	\- isolated but multiple customer instances run on shared hardware.
	\- different sizes run on the same EC2 hosts - consuming a defined allocation of resources.
	\- per second billing while an instance is running.
	\- associated resources such as storage, consume capacity, so bill regardless of state.

* Reserved Purchase Option receives highest provisioning priority on whatever capacity remains.
* No capacity reservation
* Predictable pricing
* No upfront cost
* No discount

Use case:

* Short term workloads
* Unknown workloads
* Apps which can’t be interrupted

![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024-22](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024-22.png)

**Spot Pricing**
	\- the cheapest way to get access to EC2 capacity.

- AWS selling unused EC2 host capacity at a discounted rate (up to 90%).
- spot price is dependent on the spare capacity at a given time.
- should not be viewed as reliable.
* You only ever pay the current spot price.
* Has a 2 Minute Grace Period.
* If the spot price goes beyond your maximum price then any spot instances you have are terminated.

Use case:

* Never use spot for workloads that can’t tolerate interruptions.
* Not time critical tasks.

![Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics-07-13-2024-23](images/Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud%20(EC2)%20Basics-07-13-2024-23.png)

**Reserved**
	\- for long-term consistent usage of EC2.
	\- reduces or removes per second cost.
	\- unused reservation/s are still billed.
	\- can be purchased for a particular type of instance and locked to an Availability Zone specifically or Region.
	\- reservations can have a partial effect of that partial instance.
	\- Term of 1 year or 3 years (entire term paid)(the longer the greater the discounts).

**Types of Reserved Instances**

1. Standard Reserved Instances
	\- access to the cheapest EC2 running 24/7 for 1 or 3 years.

2. Schedule Reserved Instances
	\- ideal for long term usage which doesn’t run constantly.
	\- you can specify the frequency, duration, and time.
	\- you can only use the capacity at the time you specified.

Limitations:
* Does not support all instance types or regions.
* Requires a purchase minimum of 1,200 hours per year.
* Requires a minimum of 1 year of commitment.

3. Capacity Reservations
	\- useful for when you have a requirement for some compute which can’t tolerate interruption.

	* Regional Reservation
		\- provides a billing discount for valid instance launched in any AZ in that region.
		\- don’t reserve capacity within an AZ.

	* Zonal Reservation
		\- only applies to 1 AZ providing billing discounts and capacity reservation in that AZ.

	* On-Demand Capacity Reservation
		\- can be booked to ensure you always have access to capacity in an AZ when you need it - but at full on-demand price.
		\- No term limits or minimums, but you pay regardless whether you consume it or not.

Payment Structures:

* No Upfront
	\- pay a reduced per-second fee.
	\- you pay whether the instance is running or not.

* Partial Upfront
	\- you pay a smaller lump sum in advance in exchange for a lower per-second cost.

* All Upfront
	\- whole cost of the one or the three year term in advance when you purchase the reservation.
	\- no per-second fee.

Reserved Instance Marketplace
	\- where you can sell or buy unused reserved instances.

**EC2 Savings Plan**
	\- an hourly commitment for 1 or 3 year term.
	\- products have an on-demand rate and a savings plan rate.
	\- resource usage consumes savings plan commitment at the reduced savings plan rate.
	\- beyond your commitment on-demand pricing is used.

**2 Types of Savings Plan**

1. General Compute Savings Plan
	\- save up to 66% (vs. On-Demand)
	\- applicable with EC2, Fargate, & Lambda

2.  EC2 Saving Plan
	\- offers better savings with up 72% (vs. On-Demand)
	\- flexibility on size & OS.

**Dedicated Hosts**
	\- an EC2 host allocated to you and its entirety.
	\- you pay for the host itself designed for a specific family of instances.
	\- you pay for the host.
	\- no per-second charge.
	\- if the dedicated host runs out of capacity then you can’t launch additional resources.

* Host affinity which is linking instances to certain EC2 hosts.

Use case:

* For socket and core licensing requirements.

**Dedicated Instances**
	\- instances run on an EC2 host with other instances of yours and no other customers use the same hardware.
	\- you don’t own, or share the host.
	\- Extra charges for instances, but you have dedicated hardware.
	\- you pay a one-off hourly fee for any regions you are using Dedicated Instances regardless of how many you are using.
	\- you also pay a fee for the dedicated instances itself.

## Instance Status Checks and AutoRecovery

- Every instance in EC2 has 2 High Level per instance Status Checks.

1. System Status Checks
	\- failure could indicate the loss of system power, loss of network connectivity, or software or hardware issues with the EC2 Host.
	\- issues impacting the EC2 service or EC2 host.

2. Instance Status Checks
	\- failure could indicate a corrupt file system, or incorrect networking on the instance itself.
	\- focuses on issues impacting the instances itself.

AutoRecovery
	\- moves the instance to a new host and starts it up with exactly the same configuration as before.
	\- if software on the instance is set to Auto Start, this process could mean the instance automatically recovers fully from any failed status check issues.
	\- requires having spare EC2 host capacity.
	\- requires the use of modern types of instances.
	\- does not work if you are using Instance Store Volumes.

AutoRecovery Reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-recover.html

## Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling

Vertical Scaling
	\- resizing of an instance.
	\- essentially upgrading/downgrading the specification of the instance.
	\- there is downtime (disruption) or restart during the resizing process.
	\- there is an upper cap on performance.
	\- no application modification required.
	\- works for all applications (even Monoliths)

Horizontal Scaling
	\- increasing the amount of instances running.
	\- essentially just adds more instances as load increases.
	\- Sessions are everything (State of Interaction).
	\- requires application support or Off-Host Sessions.

Off-Host Sessions
	\- session data is stored in an external database.
	\- servers become stateless through this.
	\- externally hosted sessions.

Benefits of Horizontal Scaling

* No disruption when scaling
* No real limits to scaling
* Often less expensive (No large instance premiums)
* More granular

Load Balancer
	\- an appliance which sits between your servers, and your customers.
	\- it distributes across all of the instances running your application.

## Instance Metadata

* EC2 Service provides data to Instances.
* Data about the instance that can be used to configure or manage a running instance.
* Accessible inside all instances.
* IP Address for the Metadata: http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
* Metadata allows anything running on the instance to query it for information about that instance (Information about the environment).
* Gain access to authentication.
* Metadata service is not authenticated or encryption.

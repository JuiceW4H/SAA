## EFS Architecture

* Provides network-based file systems which can be mounted within Linux EC2 Instances (/nfs/media) and used by multiple instances at once.
* An AWS implementation of a shared storage standard called Network File System (NFSv4).
* Exists separately and independently of an EC2 Instance Lifecycle.
* Private service by Default which means it’s isolated to the VPC it’s provisioned.
* Mounted via mount targets.
* Can be accessed from on-premises via VPC Peering, VPN Connections, or AWS Direct Connect.

Mount Targets
	\- provide network access points to an EFS file system from within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
	\- takes an IP address from the subnet they’re inside in.

POSIX Permissions
	\- permission definition of Users, Groups, and Others inside Linux.

**Key Concepts**

* Linux Only

**2 Types Performance Modes**

* General Purpose (Default)
	\- for latency sensitive use cases.

* Max IO
	\- scales to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per seconds.
	\- tradeoff of increases latencies.
	\- highly parallel workload.

**2 Types of Throughput Modes**

* Bursting
	\- similar to GP volumes in EBS volumes as it has a burst pool.
	\- throughput scales based on the size of the file system.

* Provisioned
	\- you can specify throughput requirements separately from size.
	\- similar to IO volumes.

**3 Types of Storage Classes**

* You can use Lifecycle policies to move data between classes.

1. Standard (Default)
	\- used for frequently accessed files.**

2. Infrequent Access (IA)
	\- lower cost storage class.
	\- designed for infrequently access data.

3. Archive

## AWS Backup

![Elastic File System (EFS) - Network Storage and Data Lifecycle-07-28-2024-2](images/Elastic%20File%20System%20(EFS)%20-%20Network%20Storage%20and%20Data%20Lifecycle-07-28-2024-2.png)

* Fully managed data-protection (backup/restore) service.
* Can copy your backups across AWS accounts and regions.
* A backup and restore product, but also includes auditing and management oversight.
* Consolidates the management of storage of backups into 1 place across multiple accounts & across regions.
* Manages both the storage and configuration of how the backup and retention operates.
* can implement a 90 day backup in Aurora.

Backup Plans
	\- configure the frequency of backups, window, lifecycle, vault, and region copy.

Resource
	\- pertains as to what is being backed up.

Vaults
	\- destination or container for backups.
	\- by default are read and write.
	\- assign KMS keys for encryption.

Vault Lock
	\- enables a Write Once Read Many (WORM) mode.
	\- once enabled there is a 72 hour cool off period, but once active no one (not even AWS) can delete anything from the vault.
	\- data retention periods still apply.

On-Demand
	\- manual backups can be created as needed.

Point In Time Recovery (PITR) Method
	\- the ability to restore the state of a resource to a specific date and time.
